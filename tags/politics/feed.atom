    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still reeling from this year of insults,
a traumatizing campaign turned traumatic election.
I&amp;#8217;m not sad about a contest lost,
but what these results mean
for real people around me.
2016 is over,
but 2017 is going to take work,
and I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months,
I&amp;#8217;ve watched my friends
(and the Internet)
cycle through denial, anger, depression,
and a million other emotions —
often turning on each other
out of fear and misunderstanding.
I&amp;#8217;ve been through a similar cycle of my own —
constantly distracted,
making phone calls,
updating my legal documentation,
struggling to get work done,
building little toy models
to calm myself,
sending donations,
hugging friends,
and breaking into tears
reading article after&amp;nbsp;article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve tried to write this post
at least 20 different times,
and I still can&amp;#8217;t get it right.
There is no right to&amp;nbsp;get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many of us,
I live at an intersection of worlds —
female, white, transgender,
able-bodied, lesbian/pan-sexual,
neurotypical, etc —
not sure if I&amp;#8217;m the primary problem
or a primary target.
Probably both.
I&amp;#8217;m tired,
and I don&amp;#8217;t know how to be useful.
How effective is art?
Am I in personal danger?
How useful is my writing?
How complicit am I in which problems,
and how do I fight back?
How can my experiences, my love,
my donations, my company, phone-calls,
or protests help&amp;nbsp;anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be strong,
but I&amp;#8217;m not.
I want to be effective,
but I don&amp;#8217;t know what that means,
and I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure it&amp;#8217;s a myth of our&amp;nbsp;culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="personal-political"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Political&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several tensions
pulling me in different directions.
Zooming in,
I see individuals hurting —
scared like me.
I know how to be a friend.
I can reach inward,
and care for my community.
I can listen to what&amp;#8217;s needed day-to-day,
and be there for the people around me.
I see you, and I love&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zooming out,
I get overwhelmed by the scale of our problems —
the ways &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/rise-of-the-davos-class-sealed-americas-fate"&gt;neoliberal&lt;/a&gt; capitalism,
misogyny, ableism, and white-supremacy
take physical form
to destroy lives in the most mundane ways.
Our representative democracy doesn&amp;#8217;t represent us all,
and never has.
The best we can hope for
is a few simple rights doled out selectively,
or not taken away —
rights we should have by&amp;nbsp;default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t want better jobs,
we want to stop selling our bodies and lives
to corporations for their profit.
We don&amp;#8217;t want to hug police officers,
we want to end the police state.
We don&amp;#8217;t want access to marriage
on hetero terms,
we want to redefine &amp;#8220;family&amp;#8221;
for ourselves.
We don&amp;#8217;t want legal weed for white entrepreneurs,
we want the the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://newjimcrow.com/"&gt;prisons emptied&lt;/a&gt;
and the war-on-drugs annulled.
We don&amp;#8217;t want the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAPL&lt;/span&gt; re-routed,
we want full sovereignty
and reparations for native tribes,
and an end to environmental&amp;nbsp;destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The status quo was bad enough,
how are we supposed to deal with&amp;nbsp;Trump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="known-unknowns"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Known&amp;nbsp;Unknowns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one knows exactly &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/21/us/politics/what-trump-wants-to-do-in-his-first-100-days-and-how-difficult-each-will-be.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;amp;smtyp=cur&amp;amp;_r=0"&gt;what will happen next&lt;/a&gt;,
but the threats against marginalized people
(and the environment)
are clear.
We understand the direction,
if not all the&amp;nbsp;details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know our government is designed to resist change,
and maybe that will work in our favor now.
But we also know how easily our institutions
are corrupted by money and fear.
Who will fight beside us?
How bad will things&amp;nbsp;get?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unknowns don&amp;#8217;t make this transition less terrifying,
and the fact that &lt;em&gt;things were bad already&lt;/em&gt;
is no consolation.
There&amp;#8217;s a lot to do,
and a lot of people that need our&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="queering-the-revolution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Queering the&amp;nbsp;Revolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a temptation to grasp for simple explanations,
with simple sides,
and even simpler solutions.
But simplifications are what got us here —
a distraction,
not a plan for change.
It&amp;#8217;s time to embrace
the complexity of human rights,
human systems,
and human identities.
Not to be stopped by wishy-washy complacency,
but to fight for &lt;em&gt;all the people&lt;/em&gt;,
no matter how messy that gets.
We need movements for intersectional empowerment
when it would be easier to throw our fringes
under the bus.
We need to challenge all our assumptions
about what is &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221;
in this queer and unusual&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening is radical,
emotions are radical,
silence can be radical,
and efficiency
is not the definition of your value.
Speaking up can also be radical,
along with rational thought,
action,
and visible results.
Progress comes in cycles of action and reflection,
mourning and anger,
give and take,
analysis and emotion.
Don&amp;#8217;t get stuck in one place.
Keep cycling.
Keep showing&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will always be arguments
about what tactics are better,
more effective,
or &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;.
Change will require
all of us doing what we can,
finding new ways to define &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt;,
and new ways of acting.
That will look different
for different people.
The bigger and more diverse the movement,
the&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#8217;s annoying,
but we need anarchists &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sheshouldrun.org/"&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to accept that no question is either or.
Individuals are not
either privileged or marginalized
with a simple on/off switch,
but shades of intersectional
identity and experience.
Resistance doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be either violent or polite,
when confrontational nonviolence
has &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/21/people-are-in-the-streets-protesting-donald-trump-but-when-does-protest-actually-work/?utm_term=.1d9c0a0f5fe8"&gt;the only reliable&amp;nbsp;track-record&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must both acknowledge
our collective and individual racism,
while we more &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&amp;#64;juliaserano/prejudice-political-correctness-and-the-normalization-of-donald-trump-28c563154e48#.eev3frwt1"&gt;clearly distinguish&lt;/a&gt; between
ignorance, complacency, prejudice,
and active white supremacy.
All bigotry is real,
no matter the intentions,
but different forms of bigotry
call for different forms of&amp;nbsp;resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can learn to dissect and identify
all the subtle micro-aggressions
of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy"&gt;kyriarchy&lt;/a&gt;,
and identify where ideas become &lt;em&gt;problematic&lt;/em&gt;,
while also understanding
that a barrage of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/16/13426448/trump-psychology-fact-checking-lies"&gt;facts&lt;/a&gt; and &amp;#8220;callouts&amp;#8221;
will &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/identities/2016/11/15/13595508/racism-trump-research-study"&gt;never bring about&lt;/a&gt;
the change we need.
We can recognize that personalized education
on privilege and oppression
is not our responsibility as minorities,
but may be our primary responsibility
as activists.
We can acknowledge that
general education is essential in the abstract,
but degrees and certifications are often
an excuse for new hierarchies,
moral requirements,
money, power, and&amp;nbsp;exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bubbles separate us,
but also keep us safe.
Self-care is essential,
and a clever cover for complacency.
Real America is rural and urban,
and infinitely diverse.
Action is essential,
and a clever cover for insecurity.
Incremental progress leaves people behind,
while revolutions often kill the most vulnerable.
We have to be political and empathetic,
listening and fighting.
Move fast and slow,
think personal and systemic.
Respect our feelings
enough to act on them,
and respect our actions
enough to feel them.
Soul-searching won&amp;#8217;t end oppression,
but it&amp;#8217;s an important part of our&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to be human,
in systems that are larger than&amp;nbsp;ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alok Vaid-Menon sums it up well
in their recent &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/AlokVaidMenon/posts/1636504483312005"&gt;new years resolution&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stop using politics to legitimize my&amp;nbsp;feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;affirm people for being needy &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; vulnerable in&amp;nbsp;public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recognize everyone else&amp;#8217;s complexity as much as i do my&amp;nbsp;own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;admit when i operate from a place of hurt &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;loneliness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;believe in all of our infinite capacity for&amp;nbsp;transformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide care as much as i provide&amp;nbsp;critique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;respect limitations &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;honor silence as a form of&amp;nbsp;presence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feel &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; love,&amp;nbsp;militantly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refuse the dismissal of art &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; interdependence &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;magic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find immensity in what they call&amp;nbsp;insignificant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a few of my&amp;nbsp;own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accept that my experiences are not&amp;nbsp;universal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;embrace a lack of answers and fear of&amp;nbsp;uselessness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show up with my entire self, broken and scared and&amp;nbsp;opinionated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="notes-on-showing-up"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes on Showing&amp;nbsp;Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some incomplete notes to myself,
for being present
in a time of&amp;nbsp;struggle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find and join the efforts already under way.
Find marginalized people
already building movements,
and support them.
Don&amp;#8217;t take over,
or dictate the terms,
or concern-troll and tone-police the movement.
Find ways to stay involved
over the long-haul —
pace yourself but take risks,
and keep showing&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check in with people who are scared or in danger.
Take care of each other.
There&amp;#8217;s emotional work to be done.
This is difficult and important.
Don&amp;#8217;t let anyone downplay
emotional experience and expression —
listening, laughing,
and having fun&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.surjaction.org/"&gt;bringing new people into the movement&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.theestablishment.co/2016/11/11/we-have-to-create-a-culture-that-wont-vote-for-trump/"&gt;creating a new culture&lt;/a&gt;.
Let marginalized groups set the priorities,
and help to amplify their voices.
Do&amp;nbsp;outreach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand and study &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code.ucsd.edu/~pcosman/Backpack.pdf"&gt;privilege&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donate time and money
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://togetherlist.com/"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt;
focused on
women, people of color,
immigrants, queers, Muslims,
disabled people, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sacredstonecamp.org/blog/2016/12/31/standing-rock-to-the-world-10-indigenous-and-environmental-struggles-you-can-support-in-2017"&gt;indigenous people&lt;/a&gt;
and our global&amp;nbsp;climate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://policy.m4bl.org/"&gt;Movement For Black Lives&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.joincampaignzero.org/#vision"&gt;Campaign Zero&lt;/a&gt;.
Get involved with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.surjaction.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SURJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donate to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.donorschoose.org"&gt;high-poverty schools&lt;/a&gt;,
and establish long-term plans for
charitable and political&amp;nbsp;giving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow these helpful
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/174f0WBSVNSdcQ5_S6rWPGB3pNCsruyyM_ZRQ6QUhGmo/htmlview"&gt;guides for calling your elected officials&lt;/a&gt;
and learn how to affect
political&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fight for diversity in your own industry,
company, and organizations —
in who you hire and what you build.
Create a better training pipeline,
improve your hiring funnel,
write a code of conduct,
address harassment
and micro-aggressions in the workplace,
and keep an eye on retention rates.
There&amp;#8217;s not one single problem,
and it will never be fully&amp;nbsp;resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long arc of the universe bends
wherever we bend&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to bring
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bC0nyqFNx6VhBgNZDB0Oan1aa0i_UtuWeBLnOPWrJ5M/preview"&gt;family and friends&lt;/a&gt;
into the movement.
It&amp;#8217;s &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/2016/11/23/13708996/argue-better-science"&gt;a skill&lt;/a&gt; that takes practice —
emotional labor that
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/2014/4/6/5556462/brain-dead-how-politics-makes-us-stupid"&gt;can&amp;#8217;t be done by listing the facts&lt;/a&gt;.
Outreach requires vulnerability,
discomfort,
and a lot of&amp;nbsp;patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build a practice of sustainable and ongoing action.
Keep looking for new ways to show up,
and leave your ego at home.
Welcome to&amp;nbsp;2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay strong.
Stay weak.
Stay present.
Keep dreaming,
and get real.
Keep crying, keep laughing, keep&amp;nbsp;fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care of each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title type="text">Some Clarifications on Trans Language</title>
    <id>http://miriamsuzanne.com/2016/12/24/clarifications</id>
    <updated>2016-12-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <link href="http://miriamsuzanne.com/2016/12/24/clarifications" />
    <author>
      <name>Miriam Suzanne</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a lot of language that gets thrown around,
but much of it comes loaded with
&lt;label for="erasure"&gt;over-simplified&lt;/label&gt; baggage and misconceptions.
Here are a few that have been on my&amp;nbsp;mind&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(See also &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://juliaserano.com/"&gt;Julia Serano&lt;/a&gt;’s wonderful
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://juliaserano.com/terminology.html"&gt;Transgender Glossary&lt;/a&gt;
if you are interested in more.
I link to it&amp;nbsp;throughout.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gender-identity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gender&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Identity&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identity comes up regularly in trans politics,
but refers to two very &lt;strong&gt;different concepts&lt;/strong&gt; —
often interchangeably,
and without&amp;nbsp;distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Our conscious acts of identifying
with a gender or sexuality —
male, female, non-binary, fluid,
straight, bi, gay,
cis, trans, &lt;strong&gt;non-conforming,&lt;/strong&gt;
or otherwise.
We all have &lt;strong&gt;multiple conscious identities,&lt;/strong&gt;
that interact and change over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those identities are curated,
public,
and often fluid.
I&amp;#8217;m still learning to identify
as a woman,
trans,
and lesbian —
even while the realities are more complex,
queer, and fluctuating.
I also identify as an author,
a web developer,
bi/pansexual,
genderqueer,
and polyamorous.
&lt;strong&gt;None of this is unique to the trans&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Our vague and &lt;strong&gt;often-elusive&lt;/strong&gt;
sense of innate gender —
something most people seem to have,
but trans people spend more time dealing with.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://juliaserano.com/terminology.html#subconscioussex"&gt;Subconscious sex&lt;/a&gt; is really a better term
for understanding trans identities.
This is not a conscious or curated self-labeling,
but more like the sensation of being
angry &lt;strong&gt;because you are hungry&lt;/strong&gt; —
a feeling that can be &lt;strong&gt;difficult to pin down&lt;/strong&gt;.
For some it is simply &lt;em&gt;male&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;female&lt;/em&gt;,
and becomes obvious early on —
but for most of us it is more complex,
and takes years to dig through &lt;strong&gt;the rubble
of&lt;/strong&gt; assumptions, fears, and prejudices
around &lt;strong&gt;our&amp;nbsp;bodies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cis people also have subconscious gender identities,
though it&amp;#8217;s more easy to assume
that your sex is completely &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://juliaserano.com/terminology.html#genderartifactualism"&gt;constructed&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://juliaserano.com/terminology.html#genderdeterminism"&gt;flows seamlessly&lt;/a&gt; from your genitalia
when it has never been &lt;strong&gt;called into&amp;nbsp;question&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="biological-sex"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Biological&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;Sex&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people distinguish &amp;#8220;gender identity&amp;#8221;
(&lt;em&gt;between the ears&lt;/em&gt;)
from &amp;#8220;biological sex&amp;#8221;
(&lt;em&gt;between the legs&lt;/em&gt;) —
as though one is natural and static,
while the other is invented or fluid.
That&amp;#8217;s a vast oversimplification of the science,
and &lt;strong&gt;a dangerous&lt;/strong&gt; false dichotomy.
Our identities don&amp;#8217;t exist outside of &lt;strong&gt;biology&lt;/strong&gt;,
and sex &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; not &lt;strong&gt;fixed&lt;/strong&gt; concept
outside our identities.
These two ideas are&amp;nbsp;inseparable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a doctor assigns our gender &lt;strong&gt;at birth&lt;/strong&gt;,
they base the assignment &lt;strong&gt;on our genitalia alone.&lt;/strong&gt;
For the many people born with &amp;#8220;ambiguous&amp;#8221; genitalia,
it&amp;#8217;s common practice for doctors to perform surgery —
assigning their &amp;#8220;biological sex&amp;#8221; by force.
There were never two discrete categories to begin&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we try to &lt;strong&gt;talk about sex&lt;/strong&gt;
as a reproductive distinction,
we&amp;#8217;re really talking about internal gonads
producing eggs or sperm:
testis and ovary.
Reproductive gonads often align with genitals,
but not always,
and not in any simple binary.
Some people are infertile,
some past menopause,
or vasectomies,
or other common reproductive changes —
making it clear that gonads
don&amp;#8217;t directly correlate with
what we call &amp;#8220;biological&amp;#8221; &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we&amp;#8217;re in public
no one knows what genitals or gonads
exist &lt;em&gt;between our legs&lt;/em&gt;,
but they feel comfortable assigning our &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt; anyway —
based on the assumptions &lt;em&gt;between their own ears&lt;/em&gt;.
Social gendering relies mainly
on &amp;#8220;secondary &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt; characteristics&amp;#8221;
(especially masculine-associated facial hair etc)
and gender presentation.
Our lived &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt; —
the way we are perceived and treated by others —
has nothing to do &lt;strong&gt;with genitals&lt;/strong&gt; or&amp;nbsp;gonads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations like the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/magazine/the-humiliating-practice-of-sex-testing-female-athletes.html"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt;
have gone further,
attempting to find a definable &amp;#8220;biological sex&amp;#8221;
in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/3/5776396/why-theyre-not-really-sex-chromosomes"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt; and hormone levels.
The results are the same wherever you look:
our biology &lt;strong&gt;is a complicated&lt;/strong&gt; mix of
genetic inclinations
that interact with our &lt;strong&gt;experiences&lt;/strong&gt;
in complex ways over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biology is fluid,
identity is biological,
and the male/female binary is &lt;strong&gt;more social than&amp;nbsp;scientific.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="transition"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Transition&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some trans people &lt;strong&gt;decide to change&lt;/strong&gt;
how we present to the world.
We transition our public personas,
hoping to bring our social lives and/or bodies
more in line with our subconscious&amp;nbsp;sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means different things for different people,
but &amp;#8220;transition&amp;#8221; is not a surgery,
transgender is not a medical term,
not &lt;strong&gt;all trans people&lt;/strong&gt; transition,
and we&amp;#8217;re not all simply men or women
&lt;em&gt;in the wrong body&lt;/em&gt;
moving from one binary to another.
Transition is a million little things,
&lt;strong&gt;for a million different&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us change our pronouns, or our names —
either informally,
or through legal channels.
Some take hormones and/or hormone-blockers,
a few get &amp;#8220;top&amp;#8221; &lt;strong&gt;surgeries&lt;/strong&gt;
to augment or remove breast tissue,
&lt;strong&gt;and even fewer&lt;/strong&gt; opt for genital surgery,
tracheal shaves,
and cosmetic&amp;nbsp;interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;After&amp;#8221; transition
(which has no real start or finish)
we &lt;strong&gt;are the same&lt;/strong&gt; person that we were before.
With or without surgery,
our genders are just as real.
Transition does not complete us
or make us &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; men and women.
My body was already female, because I was.
How and when and why we transition
is more personal and complex
than simple &lt;strong&gt;assimilation&lt;/strong&gt; into cis&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2015,
I decided to start a more intentional transition —
first socially, and then medically.
I don&amp;#8217;t believe in a &amp;#8220;true&amp;#8221; self
that was hidden before,
or in &lt;strong&gt;vague concepts of authenticity&lt;/strong&gt;,
or finally becoming whole.
I wasn&amp;#8217;t born male,
I was never a woman &lt;strong&gt;trapped in a man&amp;#8217;s&lt;/strong&gt; body,
I&amp;#8217;m not finally complete,
I was never broken,
and I will never be&amp;nbsp;fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People regularly assume that my transition
has or will soon involve &lt;strong&gt;genital surgery&lt;/strong&gt;.
Maybe. Maybe not.
But transition was never about my genitals.
Women are not vaginas,
and men are not penises.
I won&amp;#8217;t finally be a woman if I have surgery,
or let a man &lt;strong&gt;penetrate me.&lt;/strong&gt;
I&amp;#8217;m not a new or different person,
and there really was no chasm to cross over.
My gender and orientation have not changed —
only my social presentation
and hormone&amp;nbsp;levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not finally a woman,
but you are finally aware of my&amp;nbsp;womanhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="passing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Passing&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;strong&gt;strangers&lt;/strong&gt; correctly identify me as a woman,
people say that I am &amp;#8220;passing&amp;#8221; as a woman.
They&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language of passing is borrowed from racial politics
(people of color passing as white)
and later gay/lesbian politics
(femme lesbians &lt;strong&gt;or butch gays&lt;/strong&gt; passing as straight),
where &amp;#8220;passing&amp;#8221; means your marginalized identity is not&amp;nbsp;seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing is a complicated privilege —
making it possible for marginalized people
to avoid harassment and violence,
at the cost of rejecting or hiding our marginal&amp;nbsp;identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also complicated because passing
is &lt;em&gt;done to us&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;In a single moment,&lt;/strong&gt;
different people will come to different conclusions about me,
leaving me in a state of Schroedinger&amp;#8217;s gender.
My &amp;#8220;passing&amp;#8221; is based on
other people&amp;#8217;s assumptions about my&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But passing language is particularly strange for trans people,
who are said to be &amp;#8220;passing&amp;#8221; when we are identified &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt;,
in our appropriate genders.
This plays into the popular notion that
our gender is a costume we put on,
and &amp;#8220;passing&amp;#8221; &lt;strong&gt;is the entire point of transition —&lt;/strong&gt;
the only way to be trans.
People regularly try to help out
by giving us unsolicited advice
on our looks, voices, or movements —
assuming that&amp;#8217;s what we mean by &lt;em&gt;transition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a &lt;strong&gt;history&lt;/strong&gt; to that idea,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pqmonthly.com/gatekeeping-the-dark-history-of-trans-health-care/22368"&gt;enforced by the medical community&lt;/a&gt; since the 60&amp;#8217;s
when hormone replacement therapy
started to become a medically-accepted treatment.
Doctors established themselves as gender gatekeepers,
determining who could transition medically —
in part by &lt;strong&gt;enforcing strict&lt;/strong&gt; binary stereotypes.
Until recently,
medical transition was only available
if doctors thought you could &amp;#8220;pass&amp;#8221; well,
and you promised to live &lt;strong&gt;straight and stealth&lt;/strong&gt;
after transition.
The goal of &amp;#8220;passing&amp;#8221; was forced on us,
and made &lt;strong&gt;trans communities&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be more accurate to say
that I &amp;#8220;pass&amp;#8221; as cis-gender at times,
or that I previously learned
to &amp;#8220;pass&amp;#8221; (&lt;strong&gt;well enough&lt;/strong&gt;) as man.
Trans people face a real and constant threat of violence,
so blending in as cis can save our lives.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to constantly have your gender
&lt;strong&gt;called into question,&lt;/strong&gt;
or made the center of conversation.
Still, &amp;#8220;passing&amp;#8221;
is not a goal we otherwise&amp;nbsp;share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="trans-visibility"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trans&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Visibility&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few years,
everyone is talking about trans visibility.
Chaz Bono danced with the stars,
suddenly &lt;strong&gt;Lavern Cox&lt;/strong&gt; is everywhere,
Caitlin Jenner made transition
a reality &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; experience,
and now &lt;em&gt;you&amp;#8217;re reading my&amp;nbsp;blog&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New media comes out every year
highlighting trans characters —
but most of them are written, directed, and acted
by straight white men,
reinforcing stereotypes more than &lt;strong&gt;reality&lt;/strong&gt;.
When a new show or movie comes out,
we&amp;#8217;re often more scared than&amp;nbsp;excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stories tend to focus on
&amp;#8220;men who think they are women&amp;#8221;
and love doing their makeup more than anything else.
After transition they are either
&lt;strong&gt;beautiful&lt;/strong&gt; straight women who get the boy
(making them finally &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; women),
or pathetic creatures
who &lt;em&gt;need more help passing&lt;/em&gt;
to be &amp;#8220;successfully&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;trans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the &lt;strong&gt;true stories&lt;/strong&gt;
are limited to rich and beautiful women
who fit easily into our existing binary categories:
men and women,
&lt;em&gt;just like you&lt;/em&gt;.
Those stories are important,
but they aren&amp;#8217;t the whole picture.
That&amp;#8217;s not &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1962946/gender-non-conforming-identity-trans/"&gt;how we all do&amp;nbsp;trans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kate-bornstein-queer-icon-reflects-on-queer-and-trans-identity-in-2015_us_561823aae4b0e66ad4c7ff37"&gt;gender outlaws&lt;/a&gt;,
the fluid identities,
&lt;strong&gt;the femme boys and butch women&lt;/strong&gt;
who have always faced the brunt of harassment?
Where are the trans people who are complex and confused,
or happy to mix up our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/12/01/brains-arent-actually-male-or-female-new-study-suggests/?utm_term=.2fbd4f6b565c"&gt;notions of gender&lt;/a&gt;?
When we &lt;strong&gt;argue for&lt;/strong&gt; bathroom rights
based only on &lt;strong&gt;our ability&lt;/strong&gt; to conform,
we&amp;#8217;re throwing &lt;strong&gt;our own community&lt;/strong&gt; under the&amp;nbsp;bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This narrow visibility
has been a mixed bag for the trans community.
More of us are coming out,
and we&amp;#8217;re doing it more publicly.
For a minority that&amp;#8217;s been
forced into &amp;#8220;stealth&amp;#8221; invisibility,
it&amp;#8217;s wonderful to see (some of) us
moving into the light.
There&amp;#8217;s power in&amp;nbsp;numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/21/transgender-rights-backlash-anti-lgbt-legislation"&gt;backlash has been swift and deadly&lt;/a&gt; —
moving &lt;strong&gt;faster than&lt;/strong&gt; our cultural gains.
Trans women
(and especially women of color)
were already being killed at unprecedented rates —
and those numbers are higher than ever.
We&amp;#8217;ve been using bathrooms
since the invention of the toilet,
but suddenly states
are passing laws to mandate our bowel movements,
or protect housing and job discrimination
(a more basic concern for many trans people)
as &lt;strong&gt;religious&amp;nbsp;freedoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was much more visibly &lt;strong&gt;queer&lt;/strong&gt; a year ago.
In some ways my transition has made me safer,
by making me one more white woman on the street.
All my femme interests or traits that used to make me &lt;strong&gt;queer&lt;/strong&gt;
now make me invisible.
It&amp;#8217;s easy for me to disappear into
this over-simplified binary trans identity
that doesn&amp;#8217;t really reflect my experience.
I want to be a proud gender-bending &lt;strong&gt;dyke&lt;/strong&gt;,
but that&amp;#8217;s often used as &lt;strong&gt;proof&lt;/strong&gt; that I&amp;#8217;m
&lt;em&gt;really a man&lt;/em&gt;,
not &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mia-violet/yes-youre-trans-enough-to_b_9318754.html"&gt;trans enough&lt;/a&gt;,
or in need of &lt;strong&gt;gender-assimilating&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because some of us are in the &lt;strong&gt;spotlight&lt;/strong&gt;
doesn&amp;#8217;t mean we&amp;#8217;re all being&amp;nbsp;seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="just-like-not-you"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Just Like (Not)&amp;nbsp;You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the board,
marginalized groups face a complex problem
often referred to as
&lt;em&gt;respectability politics&lt;/em&gt;.
The quickest way into the mainstream
is conformity —
but what are the costs,
and who is left behind?
Many rights-movements have devolved into
&amp;#8220;just like you&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730310-100-sexuality-is-fluid-its-time-to-get-past-born-this-way/"&gt;born this way&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; rhetoric,
allowing those of us who &amp;#8220;pass&amp;#8221; in the mainstream
to go about our lives
as long as we&amp;#8217;re willing to blend&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few of us,
that&amp;#8217;s great —
or &lt;strong&gt;at least good enough&lt;/strong&gt; —
but it&amp;#8217;s not the whole story,
and it&amp;#8217;s not the end of our movement.
I don&amp;#8217;t want to get married,
and use gendered toilets
like any &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; cis straight person —
I actually want these &lt;strong&gt;systems to break down,&lt;/strong&gt;
and conform better &lt;em&gt;to us&lt;/em&gt;.
No matter how well my looks or identity
fit the popular trans mythology,
I want to &lt;strong&gt;fight for something&lt;/strong&gt; more fluid and open,
that helps the whole world be more &lt;strong&gt;queer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a &lt;strong&gt;woman,&lt;/strong&gt;
and I am not just like all cis &lt;strong&gt;women.&lt;/strong&gt;
I will continue to fight both sides of that argument,
until all my friends
have the &lt;strong&gt;right to live all our identities&lt;/strong&gt;
in the ways we see fit:
monogamous or polyamorous;
straight or bi, pan or gay;
sex workers, &lt;strong&gt;sluts,&lt;/strong&gt; and prudes;
trans-binary, &lt;strong&gt;gender-fluid, butch and femme;&lt;/strong&gt;
black, brown, immigrant, Muslim, and interracial;
asexual, intersex, &lt;strong&gt;closeted, and&amp;nbsp;queer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#8217;t keep accepting identities
one-at-a-time,
based on their ability to assimilate
with established (straight white cis) norms.
We have to &lt;strong&gt;rebuild these systems&lt;/strong&gt;
with new,
more fluid and queer&amp;nbsp;assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
