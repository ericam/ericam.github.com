I don&amp;#8217;t identify as Mennonite,

so I asked my audience what to write&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They suggested I answer a common question:

would anyone need to be&amp;nbsp;trans?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow, you all are so wonderful and generous.
Thank you so much.
I am entirely floored by this outpouring of support and love
from friends, relatives, and strangers.
I should not have expected anything else.
You&amp;#8217;ve been there for me over and over.
Why does it still take me by&amp;nbsp;surprise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep trying to write an update
worthy of your generosity.
Maybe something about how we build up shame around money,
and asking for help &amp;#8212;
friends had to convince me it was ok.
But that‚Äôs looking the wrong direction.
I want to talk about you,
&lt;em&gt;my family by choice&lt;/em&gt;
(and sometimes also&amp;nbsp;genetics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been watching &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/arts/television/pose-review-fx-ryan-murphy.html&quot;&gt;Pose&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;,
and thinking about the power of finding your chosen people &amp;#8212;
rebuilding family out of trauma, on our own terms.
I think about the years that &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; felt distant for me,
even dangerous.
I put up every wall I had,
and moved to&amp;nbsp;Denver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don&amp;#8217;t know how we got here from there.
My favorite part of transition has been
the people it keeps bringing into my life &amp;#8212;
including people I‚Äôve half-known for years,
now pulled closer.
The queers and cousins and sisters and aunts and friends
who reach out to me,
and share their own stories.
Who bring me into their lives,
and become chosen family:
not in spite of our traumas, but because of them.
Because we can cry and laugh and scream&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s too easy to look back and say &amp;quot;I built that!&amp;quot; &amp;#8212;
but it rings false.
At every step,
it&amp;#8217;s been the generosity of others inviting me in.
People sharing their struggles,
their pain, their vulnerability, their art and vision‚Ä¶
until I might learn to share mine.
I&amp;#8217;m only sorry it&amp;#8217;s taking me so&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a card in my novel
that&amp;#8217;s been rumbling around my mind lately.
The card I‚Äôve always want to lean into,
and build my life around
(though I fail&amp;nbsp;regularly):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I die they will say she kissed us all she could.
What more could we ask?
And I will say,
through a video I recorded this morning,
I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt kiss you&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;/writing/ridingsidesaddle/&quot;&gt;Riding SideSaddle*&lt;/a&gt; (a novel about chosen&amp;nbsp;family)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much love and gratitude&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;

I&amp;#8217;m excited, and terrified,
and I might start crying.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to unpack all my feelings,
so I try to focus on the details:
what needs to happen
so this goes smoothly.
Let&amp;#8217;s do&amp;nbsp;this!&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ll be having surgery on September 10,
at Denver Health.
If you want to learn more about that,
read on.
If you want to help or show support,

&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;grandma-i-was-wrong&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grandma, I was&amp;nbsp;wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early August, 2015 &amp;#8212;
I come out to my extended family
at a reunion in Michigan.
The same reunion I&amp;#8217;ll be at next week.
It&amp;#8217;s the first time I call myself trans
in front of other&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don‚Äôt know what that&amp;nbsp;means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grandma asks how often I wear dresses.
&lt;em&gt;It depends on the weather&lt;/em&gt;.
She seems happy with&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;What pronouns should we use? &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;She‚Ä¶ or they.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;I don‚Äôt like they. Are you going to have surgery? &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ think so?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;Will you still date women? &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Will they still date&amp;nbsp;me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October of that year,
I change my name publicly.
In January,
I swallow my first &lt;em&gt;hormone replacement&lt;/em&gt; pills &amp;#8212;
a mix of Spironolactone
(an androgen-blocker)
and Estradiol
(an&amp;nbsp;estrogen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 10, 2018,
I will stop taking the androgen-blockers,
after completing the first surgery of my life:
a procedure officially called vaginoplasty,
but more colloquially referred to as &lt;em&gt;bottom&amp;nbsp;surgery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grandma, I was&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;the-surgery-disclaimer&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;The Surgery&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we come out as trans,
the most common reaction
(after losing friends and family)
is to ask about &lt;em&gt;the&amp;nbsp;surgery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we ask to change the gender-markers
on government-issued documents,
many states require proof of &lt;em&gt;the&amp;nbsp;surgery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;div class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we say &lt;em&gt;transition&lt;/em&gt;
people only hear &lt;em&gt;genitals&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical terms like &lt;em&gt;Sex Reassignment Surgery&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SRS&lt;/span&gt;)
or &lt;em&gt;Gender Reassignment Surgery&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GRS&lt;/span&gt;)
also imply a &lt;em&gt;centrality&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;finality&lt;/em&gt; to this one procedure &amp;#8212;
as though we aren&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; men or women
before we&amp;#8217;ve undergone genital&amp;nbsp;reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are many aspects to transition &amp;#8212;
social, legal, and medical &amp;#8212;
with every person choosing their own path.
There is no right way to be trans,
just as there is no right way to be a&amp;nbsp;woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom surgery is only one in a long list of medical interventions
that can help reduce gender dysphoria,
and improve our quality of life.
It is absolutely necessary for some of us,
but it does not validate our genders
or transitions.
It is not the primary intervention,
nor the most common,
nor the final &amp;#8212;
but in a society that places the full weight of gender
on our genitals,
this one procedure tends to
grab the most communal (often salacious)&amp;nbsp;attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no &amp;quot;the surgery&amp;quot; for all trans people,
and there are no &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; genitals for womanhood.
I&amp;#8217;m already a complete and real woman &amp;#8212;
I only hope to relate to my body in new ways:
to trade in some of my body dysphoria
for a chance at bodily&amp;nbsp;joy.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;div class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our stories don&amp;#8217;t have to be defined by pain.
We can also strive for &lt;em&gt;comfort&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;pleasure&lt;/em&gt;
and even &lt;em&gt;ecstasy&lt;/em&gt; in our&amp;nbsp;own&amp;nbsp;bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;change-of-plans&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Change of&amp;nbsp;Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trans people are often asked to explain ourselves,
and defend our medical interventions
to a cis public that finds us fascinating or disgusting.
We are expected to beg for validity at every step &amp;#8212;
a mindset that leads directly
to the current &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/07/desistance/564560/&quot;&gt;moral panic around trans&amp;nbsp;children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t love linking The Atlantic here,
since they stoke the flames from all sides &amp;#8212;
but it&amp;#8217;s a good article on the topic.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t want to play that game,
but I am happy to share some of my experience
in case it can help other trans people
in similar&amp;nbsp;situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent years dissociating from my body &amp;#8212;
entirely unaware of the pain or identity
driving that distance.
Looking back, it&amp;#8217;s easy to read all the signs,
but at the time no one in my life
(especially me) knew what to look for.
One of my &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.carinamagyar.com/&quot;&gt;favorite comedians&lt;/a&gt; expresses this best,
with her roommate metaphor
near the end of this wonderful set.
Laugh&amp;nbsp;break!&lt;/p&gt;

  
    

    &lt;figure data-gallery=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
      

      
        
  
  
  
  

  
    &lt;div class=&quot;video&quot; data-size=&quot;full&quot; data-gallery-item=&quot;video&quot;&gt;
      &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tGn6kZJaznI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  

      
    &lt;/figure&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my transition,
I&amp;#8217;ve begun to heal that relationship with my body &amp;#8212;
but the progress is not linear or clean.
Every step forward reveals a new layer
of repressed trauma in my body,
along with a euphoria of new&amp;nbsp;discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2017
I begin to consider bottom surgery more seriously.
I do my research on &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d90SaWlODlQ&quot;&gt;how it works&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;warning: this animated video is still graphic,
and uses outdated &amp;quot;MtF&amp;quot; language&lt;/em&gt;),
and learn about the development
of genital tissue.
I begin to see my body in new ways,
and find that it&amp;#8217;s much easier to own and understand
my physical form.
I talk to friends,
and learn what to expect from surgery.
I research &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.transhealthcare.org/vaginoplasty/&quot;&gt;available surgeons&lt;/a&gt;,
and eventually send an application to &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://marcibowers.com/&quot;&gt;Dr. Marci Bowers&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212;
a ground-breaking expert in the&amp;nbsp;field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One week later,
I get a phone call from her&amp;nbsp;office:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;Are you available on June 9, 2020? &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Uh‚Ä¶&amp;nbsp;Sure?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call&amp;nbsp;mom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;Some people will struggle with this. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;What are they resisting?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;It‚Äôs like they feel about tattoos, permanent changes to your body. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Like having your ovary removed?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;Maybe it‚Äôs harder when it‚Äôs on the outside. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Great! Tell them I‚Äôm moving it to the&amp;nbsp;inside!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;the-wait&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Wait&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With limited surgeons and increased interest,
waitlists have been growing quickly.
We&amp;#8217;ve come to expect a 2-5 year wait,
and out-of-network (out-of-pocket) treatment,
far from home.
Many people wait on multiple lists,
and hope to get moved up after a cancelation.
But recently,
there&amp;#8217;s been a push for more doctors
to become&amp;nbsp;certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a wonderful development,
but what we gain in access and affordability,
we lose in detailed knowledge about our surgeons
and their credentials.
This used to be a specialty procedure,
performed by the well-known expert of your choice
(if you can afford it).
As it becomes more common
and covered by insurance,
most of us simply have to go where we&amp;#8217;re told.
Meanwhile, there are no national standards for certification,
and each hospital is making it up as they&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#8217;m looking into insurance options,
I discover that Denver Health
is working with Dr Bowers to train two local surgeons,
and a Denver Health insurance plan
would be guaranteed to cover
this new Denver Health surgery.
I switch my insurance at the end of the year,
apply for the new &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DH&lt;/span&gt; waiting list,
and immediately begin preparation.
With an unknown timeline,
I want to be&amp;nbsp;ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I do some research on my new surgeon,
Dr Chris Carey.
Previous patients of Dr Carey recommend him,
and he seems to have experience and training
to back up his new credentials.
I sure hope that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early July, I get the&amp;nbsp;call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Can you be ready in August? &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212; &lt;em&gt;No, I&amp;#8217;ll be traveling.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212; Have you completed hair removal? &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212; &lt;em&gt;Mostly.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212; Get it&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They call again this&amp;nbsp;week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; You&amp;#8217;re traveling, right? When will you get home? &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212; &lt;em&gt;September 9.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212; Can we schedule you on September&amp;nbsp;10?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: var(--xlarge);&quot;&gt;üò≥üò≥üò≥üòèüòÇ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;how-can-i-help&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;How Can I&amp;nbsp;Help?&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve started to share the news,
several people have asked how they can&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be in the hospital for 3-4 days.
After that,
recovery is slow and difficult &amp;#8212;
with 4-6 weeks of limited movement
before I&amp;#8217;m back to my routine,
and back to work.
My bills and my boredom are likely to pile up,
so you can help with either or&amp;nbsp;both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;boredom&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Boredom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have three amazing women
who will be my primary caretakers
during recovery &amp;#8212;
Erin, Rachel, and my mom &amp;#8212;
but it would be great to have visitors,
or help with meals along the way.
This is hard to plan in advance,
since we&amp;#8217;re not entirely sure
when I&amp;#8217;ll have time or energy.
If you want to drop by the hospital
(Sept 10-13),
or my house (through mid-Oct),
get in touch with one of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need contact information,
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;/contact/&quot;&gt;let us&amp;nbsp;know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;bills&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Bills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my insurance,
I expect to pay roughly $1,300 in preparation
(surgery-site hair removal),
and another $7,150 for the surgery
(my out-of-pocket maximum).
I will also lose 6 weeks wages,
while trying to cover all my normal expenses.
All told, I&amp;#8217;m looking at $10k-12k
in surgery-related&amp;nbsp;costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a debt I&amp;#8217;m willing to take on,
but it&amp;#8217;s not money that I have.
If you want to help financially,
either by &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://squareup.com/store/mirisuzanne&quot;&gt;purchasing art&lt;/a&gt;,
or with a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/mias-medical-upgrade&quot;&gt;direct gift&lt;/a&gt;,
any amount will help make a&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Support&amp;nbsp;Others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for all the support
that you&amp;#8217;ve shown me through my transition.
I feel very lucky to have friends and family
that have stood by me,
and asked how to be&amp;nbsp;helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of my friends are less fortunate.
Here are a few places you can volunteer or donate
to help trans people more&amp;nbsp;broadly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are other issues in the world
that also need money and attention.
Support immigrants, and refugees,
and anyone else who needs&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for all your love and support
over the last few years &amp;#8212;
it means the world to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the book in a digital age?
Is it a physical object containing pages encased in covers?
Is it a portable device that gives us access to entire libraries?
The codex, the book as bound paper sheets, emerged around 150 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt;.
It was preceded by clay tablets and papyrus scrolls.
Are those books?
In this volume in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; Press Essential Knowledge series,
Amaranth Borsuk considers the history of the book,
the future of the book, and the idea of the book.
Tracing the interrelationship of form and content in the book‚Äôs development,
she bridges book history, book arts, and electronic literature
to expand our definition of an object we thought we knew&amp;nbsp;intimately.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the family vacation in Moab,
everyone is doing their best.
It‚Äôs not enough,
and my day is peppered with the wrong name and pronouns.
I hide in my room through dinner
so they won‚Äôt see me&amp;nbsp;crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender is strange and elusive.
Sometime we attach it to genitals,
and sometimes we attach it to boats.
In Spanish, I can misgender my table.
Every day we gender each other, even strangers ‚Äì
at a glance, on instinct, with very little to go&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some gendering is obvious ‚Äì
from pronouns (&lt;em&gt;he/she/they&lt;/em&gt;)
to honorifics (&lt;em&gt;sir/ma‚Äôam&lt;/em&gt;),
and gendered nouns like &lt;em&gt;ladies&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;gentlemen&lt;/em&gt;.
Things get more subtle when we talk about groups (&lt;em&gt;hey guys&lt;/em&gt;),
or the way servers
(should I say &lt;em&gt;waiters&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;waitresses&lt;/em&gt;?)
are trained to serve women first and bring men the check.
No matter how we see ourselves,
our existence is constantly gendered
(and misgendered)
by the people around us.
I notice every&amp;nbsp;instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been misgendered most of my life,
usually by accident.
As a child,
I was only gendered correctly with insults.
Looking back,
&lt;em&gt;‚Äúlong haired African girl‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;
seems a bit on-the-nose.
I had long hair,
was born in Lesotho,
and now I discover I‚Äôm a woman.
Three for three!
How is that&amp;nbsp;insulting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I‚Äôm mid-transition,
the gendering
(and misgendering)
has taken on a new flavor ‚Äì
a sense of personal success or failure
added to the experience.
I don‚Äôt mean to imply
that the goal of transition is always to be properly gendered,
but &lt;em&gt;wouldn‚Äôt it be nice&lt;/em&gt;?
When people assume I‚Äôm cisgender,
life is simpler and safer ‚Äì
if lacking the nuance of queer diversity.
Even condescending and sexist phrases can feel refreshing ‚Äì
&lt;em&gt;at least I‚Äôm being gendered&amp;nbsp;correctly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People rarely misgender me these days,
so the sting is worse when it happens.
Strangers on the phone,
old friends on occasion,
or someone just discovering that I‚Äôm trans;
but mostly family.
The people who have known me since birth.
And when it happens,
someone is always there to say:
well, &lt;em&gt;it‚Äôs&amp;nbsp;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve misgendered people too,
used the wrong pronoun,
or even a deadname in my worst moments.
It‚Äôs an accident, of course,
and I feel terrible about it ‚Äì
most of us do.
Intentional misgendering is violent verbal abuse,
but accidental misgendering is more complex.
And more&amp;nbsp;painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gendering is instinct, learned at a young age ‚Äì
deeply ingrained, subconscious, and instantaneous.
We use names and pronouns without thinking,
and get them wrong without noticing our mistake.
Sometimes it means we haven&amp;#8217;t shifted our perceptions of a person
and have work to do.
Often, we&amp;#8217;re just bumbling our way through
every child-and-dog-name in our heads before we get to the right word.
My aunt flips through all her children and my deadname
before she gets to &lt;em&gt;Mia&lt;/em&gt;.
It would be funny if I wasn‚Äôt already&amp;nbsp;hurting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brains are strange and language is fragile.
When people tell me (over and over) that &lt;em&gt;it&amp;#8217;s hard&lt;/em&gt;,
I know what they mean.
It is hard for all of us.
I know. We&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I‚Äôm misgendered, none of that&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room becomes a sudden minefield
and time slows down.
Everyone seems on edge,
unsure what happens next.
One person is feeling bad for their mistake,
aware that they‚Äôve hurt me,
and everyone can relate.
&lt;em&gt;There, but for the grace of various gods‚Ä¶&lt;/em&gt;
All eyes are on me.
I‚Äôm not thinking about the semantic slip
or the person behind it,
I‚Äôm trying desperately
to hold my fear and self-loathing at&amp;nbsp;bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never wanted to be trans.
When I look in the mirror sometimes,
it‚Äôs all I see.
Then I have to leave the house ‚Äì
go out in public,
where my existence is so offensive
they pass laws about it.
I‚Äôm a national threat.
I get my own special &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TSA&lt;/span&gt; pat-down
and papers-please potty&amp;nbsp;regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not fragile,
and I don‚Äôt want pity or condolences.
I have a good life,
with supportive friends and family.
I&amp;#8217;m not depressed,
and I‚Äôm not in
constant or unbearable pain.
But the othering and double-standards wear me down.
The shame becomes ingrained and&amp;nbsp;internalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I go outside?
Can I use a bathroom?
Who might attack me?
Will I ever date again?
What if I&amp;#8217;m a pathetic joke everywhere I go?
Is everyone laughing behind my&amp;nbsp;back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the misgendering were intentional,
I could brush it off more easily.
Being an asshole reflects poorly on the offender,
not on me.
But when it‚Äôs an accident
it feels personal,
like it‚Äôs my fault.
I brought this on myself.
I‚Äôm asking too much of the people around me.
I look too trans, or speak too deep.
Maybe people are only humoring me,
and the ruse is up.
Now everyone feels bad
because of something I did.
My trans pain is upsetting these people I love,
and I‚Äôm&amp;nbsp;responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine people are thinking about my genitals,
or my deadname, or my years as a ‚Äòboy‚Äô.
I know I&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs no time to take care of myself.
Everyone is anxious, alert, and watching me.
If I fall apart, I look fragile.
If I get upset, I‚Äôll make it worse.
Simply pointing to the mistake can make people defensive,
and I‚Äôm seen as the aggressor.
If I brush it off,
people think it doesn‚Äôt bother me ‚Äì
&lt;em&gt;not like the others, thank god&lt;/em&gt;.
I don‚Äôt want a confrontation.
I don‚Äôt want anyone to be sorry,
or feel terrible,
or lose sleep over me.
I don‚Äôt want a conversation,
and I don‚Äôt want a reminder that
&lt;em&gt;it‚Äôs hard&lt;/em&gt; not to hurt&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being misgendered is not like being offended ‚Äì
not intellectual, but emotional.
In that moment,
I‚Äôm not mad or insulted ‚Äì
I‚Äôm sad and lonely,
discouraged and afraid.
I feel bulky, masculine, and in the way.
My mind is racing,
and I need a way&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we misgender people,
we tend to focus on the shame of our mistake,
and how bad we feel for causing pain ‚Äì
or how hard it is to change our gendered instincts.
We jump to long-winded apologies and explanations
that only take us away
from the opportunity
to make things&amp;nbsp;better‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;docutils&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Moab with my family,
I post a note to Facebook
knowing my trans friends,
at least, will send me support ‚Äì
and they do (along with others).
My brother also senses the problem,
and he&amp;#8217;s ready when I come downstairs.
In the kitchen,
he slides up beside me
and says the one thing that actually&amp;nbsp;helps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey&amp;nbsp;sis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
