    <section data-module="rst" >
      <p>There are some questions that come up again and again
if you are trans.
Some of those questions are terrible,
but most of them are well-intentioned.
I&#8217;m lucky to have a supportive community around me,
so I thought I&#8217;d write down a few answers
to help ease your stress about
<em>getting it right</em>,
and ease my stress about
answering the same questions over and&nbsp;over.</p>
<p><em>These answers are very much my own.
I am not attempting to speak for anyone else.
If you don&#8217;t know how to relate to another trans person,
you should ask&nbsp;them!</em></p>
<div class="section" id="i-heard-you-shouldn-t-ask-trans-people-questions">
<h2>I heard you shouldn&#8217;t ask trans people&nbsp;questions</h2>
<p>You should relate to trans people
the same way you relate to other people.
If we&#8217;re really close and talk about everything,
you can ask me anything!
If we&#8217;re not, you&nbsp;can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>You know how to filter what&#8217;s appropriate,
the same as you do every day
in millions of different situations.
If you have questions that are appropriate,
I&#8217;d love to&nbsp;talk!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-should-i-call-you">
<h2>What should I call&nbsp;you?</h2>
<p>Miriam.</p>
<p>Or <em>Mia</em>,
if you&#8217;re into brevity.
Sometimes I&nbsp;am.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-pronouns-should-i-use">
<h2>What pronouns should I&nbsp;use?</h2>
<p>She, her, and&nbsp;hers.</p>
<p>Or <em>they</em>,
if you&#8217;re into ambiguity.
Sometimes I&nbsp;am.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-refer-to-you-in-the-past">
<h2>How do I refer to you in the&nbsp;past?</h2>
<p>See above.
My name is Miriam,
and I use she/her pronouns.
That name and those pronouns can be used for any time period,
because they refer to me,
not my age or&nbsp;presentation-at-the-time.</p>
<p>If you went by &#8220;Johnny&#8221; as a child,
but now you go by &#8220;John&#8221;,
I don&#8217;t need to adjust your name to the exact time period
I&#8217;m talking about —
I can just use your name.
Remember when John was a&nbsp;kid?</p>
<p>Unless my dead name is specifically relevant to the conversation
(it usually isn&#8217;t),
there is no need to use it or mention it.
Even if you are quoting someone in the past,
it won&#8217;t ruin the story to use my current name —
it will just make things more clear.
Who are you talking about? Miriam.
Oh, I know her.
She&#8217;s right&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>You are probably paraphrasing already,
because your memory isn&#8217;t that good.
What&#8217;s one more editorial adjustment going to&nbsp;hurt?</p>
<p>If my dead name is relevant,
just make sure you aren&#8217;t outing me.
You might not notice,
but even when they are well-meaning
people treat me differently once I&#8217;ve been outed.
If they&#8217;re not well meaning,
I could be in real&nbsp;danger.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very public,
and usually happy to be out,
but not in every situation,
and not when I&#8217;m outed by someone&nbsp;else.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-i-have-fond-terrible-memories-of-e">
<h2>But I have fond/terrible memories of&nbsp;E—</h2>
<p>Those are memories of me,
and my name is Miriam.
I was not a different person then.
I haven&#8217;t transtioned lives,
I&#8217;ve only transitioned what you call&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>When I say &#8220;I&#8217;m transitioning&#8221;
I mostly mean
&#8220;I&#8217;m teaching you to see&nbsp;me&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-if-i-get-your-name-or-pronoun-wrong">
<h2>What if I get your name or pronoun&nbsp;wrong?</h2>
<p>If you slip up,
you may feel nervous or upset with yourself.
I&#8217;m not thinking about you —
I&#8217;m feeling guilty, sad,
and worried about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jennamcwilliams.com/2016/08/07/what-do-to-if-you-use-the-wrong-pronouns-for-me/">what&#8217;s going to happen&nbsp;next</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Best case scenario,
you correct yourself and move&nbsp;on.</li>
<li>Hopefully you&#8217;ll slip the correct pronoun
into the conversation&nbsp;<span class="caps">ASAP</span>.</li>
<li>You can apologize later,
but I&#8217;d rather you just get it right the next&nbsp;time.</li>
<li>Please don&#8217;t make a big fuss about it,
especially in a group&nbsp;setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pronouns can be hard if you&#8217;ve never had to think about them before.
Most people use them without even noticing.
The best way to start getting pronouns right for people,
is to make pronouns intentional.
It takes some practice,
but you can start noticing every single pronoun you use.
Once you are paying attention,
it&#8217;s much easier to adjust
from one situation to the&nbsp;next.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="should-i-update-my-old-blog-post-or-website-that-mentions-you">
<h2>Should I update my old blog post or website that mentions&nbsp;you?</h2>
<p>Probably.
I&#8217;d love for you to update my name anywhere you can.
I&#8217;m not scouring the interwebs to find every instance,
but I might ask you to update my name if I see it.
Not because I need to erase any mention of my past,
but because it&#8217;s confusing to refer to a person by a name they don&#8217;t&nbsp;use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-about-this-old-photo-i-have">
<h2>What about this old photo I&nbsp;have?</h2>
<p>If you have a headshot of me before I started transtion,
please replace it with a recent headshot.
You can find several <a class="reference external" href="/who/">on the about&nbsp;page</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a photo of us together,
or me in some specific context
(like speaking at a conference),
don&#8217;t worry about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t love old pictures of me,
but who does?
That was me,
and I&#8217;m not interested in
losing all references to my past.
It&#8217;s a trade-off I&#8217;m willing to live&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>Many trans people will want to remove all old photos,
and they have <em>very good reasons for it</em>.
If someone else you know transitions,
don&#8217;t assume my answer is true for them&nbsp;—&nbsp;ask!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-trans-terms-can-i-use">
<h2>What trans terms can I&nbsp;use?</h2>
<p>I call myself trans, transgender, or a trans woman.
I&#8217;m also gender-queer, non-binary, and a bunch of other good words.
I&#8217;m also transsexual,
but that one feels to me like a medical term —
similar to using &#8220;females&#8221; when you mean women.
You can probably just call me a&nbsp;woman.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the
specific meanings and political debates
around trans terminology,
I recommend starting with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.juliaserano.com/terminology.html">Julia Serano</a>’s extensive writing on the&nbsp;topic.</p>
<p>Some people also like to differentiate
between &#8220;sex&#8221; and &#8220;gender&#8221; —
as though one is biology and the other is identity.
Don&#8217;t do that.
Biology and identity are deeply intertwined,
and neither of them is binary.
There is only gender,
and it is always a rough approximation
of a million different factors,
<a class="reference external" href="http://juliaserano.blogspot.com/2013/11/what-is-gender-artifactualism.html">both social and&nbsp;biological</a>.</p>
<p>Sex is something else entirely,
and I recommend it,
if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.
Stay safe,&nbsp;kids.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-i-be-a-helpful-friend-ally">
<h2>Can I be a helpful&nbsp;friend/ally?</h2>
<p>You&nbsp;can!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you hear someone misgender or deadname me in person,
use my correct name and pronouns as soon as you can.
It will help them remember without making a fuss,
and it will help me&nbsp;relax.</li>
<li>Again, if I&#8217;m around, try not to make a big fuss.
You can pull them aside later if you have&nbsp;to.</li>
<li>If you see an old site/post that needs updating,
feel free to contact the author and point them&nbsp;here.</li>
<li>If we&#8217;re in a group with people I&#8217;m not out to,
or you aren&#8217;t sure,
don&#8217;t out&nbsp;me.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;ve known me for a long time,
you might have a hard time updating your perception of me.
You might think other people see the same thing you do.
They don&#8217;t.
Most people I meet
never question my gender.
Learn to think like those&nbsp;people.</p>
