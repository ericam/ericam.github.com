      <p>There are some questions that come up again and again
if you are trans.
A few of those questions are terrible,
but most of them are well-intentioned.
I&#8217;m lucky to have a supportive community around me,
so I thought I&#8217;d write down my most common answers
to help ease your stress about
<em>getting it right</em>,
and <strong>ease my stress about</strong>
answering the same questions over and&nbsp;over.</p>
<p><em>These answers are very much my own.
I am not attempting to speak for anyone else.
If you don&#8217;t know how to relate to another trans person,
you should talk to&nbsp;them!</em></p>
<p>If you are interested in queer art
<strong>more than queer</strong> answers,
check out my novel: <a class="reference external" href="http://ridingsidesaddle.com/">Riding SideSaddle*</a>.
It&#8217;s totally about transition,
<strong>and totally</strong> not-at-all about transition.
It&#8217;s about <strong>bodies</strong> and identities that won&#8217;t stay put.
I think you might <strong>enjoy&nbsp;it</strong>.</p>
<div class="section" id="i-heard-you-shouldn-t-ask-trans-people-questions">
<h2>I heard you shouldn&#8217;t ask trans people&nbsp;questions&#8230;</h2>
<p>You should relate to <strong>trans people</strong>
the same way you relate to other people.
Some questions are appropriate,
and some aren&#8217;t.
You already know how to filter what&#8217;s appropriate:
<strong>you do</strong> it every day,
in millions of different situations.
My transness doesn&#8217;t change the calculation at all.
If we&#8217;re really close and talk about everything,
you can ask me anything!
If we&#8217;re not, you&nbsp;can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>If <strong>you</strong> do have appropriate questions,
I&#8217;d love to talk!
Some questions are better in person,
but I&#8217;m always hanging out on <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/mirisuzanne">Twitter</a> as well,
and I have a <a class="reference external" href="/contact/">nifty contact form</a> if you need&nbsp;it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-should-i-call-you">
<h2>What should I call&nbsp;you?</h2>
<p>Miriam.</p>
<p>Or <em>Mia</em>,
if you&#8217;re into&nbsp;brevity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-pronouns-should-i-use">
<h2>What pronouns should I&nbsp;use?</h2>
<p>She, her, and&nbsp;hers.</p>
<p>Or <em>they</em>,
if you&#8217;re into&nbsp;ambiguity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-refer-to-you-in-the-past">
<h2>How do I refer to you in the&nbsp;past?</h2>
<p>See above.
<strong>My name is Miriam</strong>,
and I use she/her pronouns.
That name and those pronouns can be used for any time <strong>period</strong>,
because they refer to me,
not my age or&nbsp;presentation-at-the-time.</p>
<p>If you went by &#8220;Johnny&#8221; as a child,
but now you go by &#8220;John&#8221;,
and maybe you used your middle name for a few years in High School,
I don&#8217;t need to adjust for the exact time period
<strong>I&#8217;m talking about</strong> —
I can just use your name.
Your name is <strong>John.</strong>
<em>Remember when John was a&nbsp;kid?</em></p>
<p>Unless my dead name is specifically relevant to the conversation
(it usually isn&#8217;t),
there is no need to use it or mention it.
Even if you are quoting someone <strong>in the past,</strong>
it won&#8217;t ruin the story to use my current name —
it will just make things more clear.
<strong>Who are you talking about?</strong>
Miriam.
<em>Oh, I know her.
She&#8217;s right&nbsp;here.</em></p>
<p><strong>You are probably</strong> paraphrasing already,
because your memory isn&#8217;t that good.
What&#8217;s one more editorial adjustment going to&nbsp;hurt?</p>
<p>If my <strong>dead</strong> name is relevant,
just make sure you aren&#8217;t outing me.
You might not notice,
but even when people are well-meaning,
they treat me differently once I&#8217;ve been outed.*
If they&#8217;re not well meaning,
I could be <strong>in real&nbsp;danger</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very public,
and usually happy to be out,
but not <strong>in every situation</strong>,
and not when I&#8217;m outed by someone&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>*
<em>See Julia Serano&#8217;s concept of &#8220;ungendering&#8221; trans people —
seaking out any physical/habitual traits
that might &#8220;prove&#8221; their &#8220;real&#8221; gender.
I can&#8217;t find a good&nbsp;link&#8230;</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-i-have-fond-terrible-memories-of-e">
<h2>But I have fond/terrible memories of&nbsp;E—</h2>
<p>Those are memories of me,
and <strong>my name is Miriam</strong>.
I was not a different person then.
I haven&#8217;t transtioned lives,
I&#8217;ve only transitioned what you call&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>When I say &#8220;I&#8217;m transitioning&#8221;
I mostly mean
&#8220;I&#8217;m teaching you to see&nbsp;me&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-if-i-get-your-name-or-pronoun-wrong">
<h2>What if I get your name or pronoun&nbsp;wrong?</h2>
<p>If you slip up,
you may feel nervous or upset with yourself.
<strong>I&#8217;m</strong> not <strong>thinking about you</strong> —
I&#8217;m feeling guilty, sad,
and worried about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jennamcwilliams.com/2016/08/07/what-do-to-if-you-use-the-wrong-pronouns-for-me/">what&#8217;s going to happen&nbsp;next</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Best case scenario,
you correct yourself and move&nbsp;on.</li>
<li>Hopefully you&#8217;ll slip the correct name/pronoun
into the conversation&nbsp;asap.</li>
<li>You can apologize later,
but I&#8217;d rather you just get it right the next time.
The sooner the&nbsp;better.</li>
<li>Please don&#8217;t make a big fuss about it,
especially in a group&nbsp;setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pronouns can be hard
if you&#8217;ve never had to think about them before.
Most people use them without even noticing.
Pronouns are instinct,
and if you&#8217;re not paying attention to them,
you&#8217;ll get them wrong without even realizing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s time for everyone to start practicing.
Make an effort to notice <em>every pronoun you ever use</em>.
It takes some <strong>work</strong>,
but it&#8217;s worth the effort.
Once you are paying attention,
it&#8217;s much easier to adjust
from one situation to the&nbsp;next.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="should-i-update-my-old-blog-post-or-website-that-mentions-you">
<h2>Should I update my old blog post or website that mentions&nbsp;you?</h2>
<p>Probably.
I&#8217;d love for you to update my name anywhere you can.
<strong>I&#8217;m</strong> not <strong>scouring the interwebs</strong> to find every instance,
but I might ask you to update my name if I see it.
Not because <label for="erasure">I need to erase</label> any mention of my past,
but because it&#8217;s confusing to refer to a person by a name they don&#8217;t&nbsp;use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-about-this-old-photo-i-have">
<h2>What about this old photo I&nbsp;have?</h2>
<p>If you have a headshot of me before I started transtion,
please replace it with <strong>a recent headshot</strong>.
You can find several <a class="reference external" href="/who/">on my about&nbsp;page</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a photo of us together,
<strong>or</strong> me in some specific context
(like at a conference),
leave it up.
I don&#8217;t love old pictures of me,
but who does?
That was me,
and <strong>I&#8217;m not interested in</strong>
losing all proof of my existence before 2015.
It&#8217;s <strong>a trade-off</strong> I&#8217;m happy to live&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>Many trans people will want to remove all old photos,
and they have <em>very good reasons for it</em>.
If you know someone else transitioning,
don&#8217;t assume my answer is true for them&nbsp;—&nbsp;ask!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-i-be-a-helpful-friend-ally">
<h2>Can I be a helpful&nbsp;friend/ally?</h2>
<p>You&nbsp;can!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you hear someone misgender or deadname me in person,
use my correct name and pronouns as soon as you can.
<strong>It will help</strong> them remember without making a fuss,
and it will help me&nbsp;relax.</li>
<li>Again, if I&#8217;m around, try not to make a big fuss.
You can pull them aside later if you have&nbsp;to.</li>
<li>If you see <strong>an old</strong> site/post that needs updating,
feel free to contact the author and point them&nbsp;here.</li>
<li>If we&#8217;re in a group with <strong>people I&#8217;m not out to</strong>,
or you aren&#8217;t sure,
don&#8217;t out&nbsp;me.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;ve known me for a long time,
you might <strong>have a hard time</strong> updating your perception of me.
You might think other people see the same thing you do.
They don&#8217;t.
Most people I meet
never question my gender.
Learn to see me like those&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>You should also feel free to share this post,
or point people to it,
if you find it helpful.
I posted it on the internet for anyone to read.
I&#8217;m not the final word on anything trans,
but I&#8217;m glad to be part of the&nbsp;conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-trans-terms-should-i-use-and-where-can-i-learn-more">
<h2>What trans terms should I use, and where can I learn&nbsp;more?</h2>
<p>If you are interested in the
specific meanings and political debates
around trans terminology,
I recommend starting with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.juliaserano.com/terminology.html">Julia Serano</a>’s extensive writing on the topic.
<strong>I recommend everything</strong> Julia has written,
especially her first book: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1580056229/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1/151-5666770-2045969">Whipping Girl</a>.
You can also read
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.jenniferboylan.net/">Jennifer Boylan</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://katebornstein.com/">Kate Bornstein</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://janetmock.com/">Janet Mock</a>,
to list a few popular ones.
Books and articles by cis people,
<strong>about transgender people</strong>,
should be taken with salt or avoided&nbsp;entirely.</p>
<p>I call myself trans, transgender, or a trans woman.
I&#8217;m <strong>also gender-queer</strong>, non-binary, and a bunch of other good words.
I&#8217;m transsexual,
but that one feels like a medical term —
similar to using &#8220;females&#8221; when you mean women.
<strong>You can probably just call me a&nbsp;woman.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some people like</strong> to differentiate
between &#8220;sex&#8221; and &#8220;gender&#8221; —
as though one is biology and the other is identity.
Don&#8217;t bother.
Biology and identity are deeply intertwined,
and neither of them is binary.
There is only gender,
and it is always <strong>a rough approximation of</strong>
a million different factors:
<a class="reference external" href="http://juliaserano.blogspot.com/2013/11/what-is-gender-artifactualism.html">social, biological, and&nbsp;experienced</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sex is</strong> something else entirely,
and I recommend it,
if you&#8217;re into that sort of&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>Stay <strong>safe,&nbsp;kids</strong>.</p>
