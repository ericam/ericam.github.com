    <section data-module="rst" >
      <p>There&#8217;s a lot of language that gets thrown around,
and some of it comes loaded with misconceptions.
Here&#8217;s a brief guide to a few on my&nbsp;mind:</p>
<div class="section" id="gender-identity">
<h2>Gender&nbsp;&#8220;Identity&#8221;</h2>
<p>This is a popular trans phrase right now,
but it commonly refers to two very different things,
interchangeably, and without&nbsp;distinction.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Our conscious acts of identifying with a gender —
male, female, non-binary, fluid,
or otherwise —
whether cis or trans or altogether non-conforming.
I&#8217;m still learning to identify as a <em>woman</em>,
as <em>trans</em>,
and as a <em>lesbian</em> —
even while the realities are more complex,
queer, and&nbsp;fluctuating.</p>
<p>Those identities are curated,
and change over time.
I also consciously identify as an <em>author</em>,
a <em>web developer</em>,
<em>pan-sexual</em>,
and <em>polyamorous</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Our vague and often-elusive
sense of our own gender —
something most people seem to have,
but trans people spend more time dealing with.
<a class="reference external" href="http://juliaserano.com/terminology.html#subconscioussex">Subconsious sex</a> is really a better term
for understanding the trans experience.
For some of us it becomes obvious early on,
but for many it takes years to dig through the rubble
of assumptions and fears that cloud our&nbsp;understanding.</p>
<p>Cis people also have subconsious genders,
though it is easy for many cis people to assume
that their sex is completely <a class="reference external" href="http://juliaserano.com/terminology.html#genderartifactualism">constructed</a>
or flows seemlessly from their genitals,
since it is never called into&nbsp;question.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="biological-sex">
<h2><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Biological&#8221;&nbsp;Sex</h2>
<p>Many people distinguish &#8220;gender identity&#8221;
(<em>between the ears</em>)
from &#8220;biological sex&#8221;
(<em>between the legs</em>) —
but that&#8217;s a vast oversimplification of the science,
and a dangerous false dichotome.
Our identities don&#8217;t exist outside of biology,
and sex is not a solid concept outside our&nbsp;identities.</p>
<p>When a doctor assigns our gender at birth,
they base the assignment on our genitalia alone.
For the many people born with &#8220;ambiguous&#8221; genitalia,
it&#8217;s common practice for doctors to perform surgery —
assigning their &#8220;biological sex&#8221; by&nbsp;force.</p>
<p>When we try to talk about sex
as a more &#8220;scientific&#8221; reproductive distinction,
we&#8217;re really talking about gonads: testis and ovary.
Reproductive gonads often align with genitals,
but not always.
Add in menopause, vasectomies,
and other common reproductive changes,
and it&#8217;s clear that gonads
don&#8217;t directly determine what we think of as&nbsp;gender.</p>
<p>When we&#8217;re in public
no one knows what genitals or gonads
exist between our legs,
but they feel comfortable assigning genders anyway.
Social gendering relies mainly
on &#8220;secondary&#8221; sex characteristics —
those physical traits we associate with men or women,
not directly related to reproduction:
facial/body hair, breasts, adam&#8217;s apple, etc.
Again, the association has some biological basis,
but is entirely unreliable.
Ask any woman with facial&nbsp;hair.</p>
<p>Competitive organizations
like the International Olympic Committee
have given up on both genitals and gonads.
They need a more reliable criteria,
but science keeps queering up the&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re taught that chromosomes are the source of sex,
<span class="caps">XX</span> for women and <span class="caps">XY</span> for men,
so the <span class="caps">IOC</span> ran chromosom tests for years —
but only discovered the prevalance of intersex conditions,
<span class="caps">XXY</span> chromosomes,
and bodies that don&#8217;t conform in any way
to their required&nbsp;binary.</p>
<p>Since there is no clear answer <em>at the source</em>,
the <span class="caps">IOC</span> is now trying to use
the most relevant-seeming bi-product of gender —
testosterone levels —
to determine the &#8220;biological sex&#8221; of olympic athletes.
Again, it turns out there is too much overlapping variation
for any clear lines to be drawn.
Does a woman stop being a woman
because her body produced &#8220;too much&#8221; testosterone?
Of course&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>(It turns out athletes feel violated and angry
when their life-long gender experience and identity
is called into public question —
always because women are performing <em>too well</em>,
and must be secretly&nbsp;male&#8230;)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to say that I have an intersex condition,
or that biology and gender are unrelated.
The problem with this term and conversation
is that &#8220;biology&#8221; is not static,
gender is not an on/off switch,
and none of these traits exist in a distinct&nbsp;binary.</p>
<p>Our biological sex is a complicated mix of
countless genetic inclinations
that interact with our experiences in different ways over time.
In the end,
there is no reasonable distinction
between gender as a fluid identity
and sex as a biological&nbsp;reality.</p>
<p>The reality is that we have bodies and identities
based in complex biology,
and changing over time.
The science acts to obscure our assumptions
more than it can clarify&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Kinda like this&nbsp;article&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gender-transition">
<h2>Gender&nbsp;&#8220;Transition&#8221;</h2>
<p>Some trans people decide to change
how they present to the world.
We transition our public personas,
hoping to bring our social lives and/or bodies
more in line with our subconsious&nbsp;sex.</p>
<p>That means different things for different people.
I don&#8217;t believe in a &#8220;true&#8221; self that was hidden,
or in vague concepts of authenticity,
and finally becoming whole.
I do believe in taking action when I&#8217;m frustrated,
and building the life I want,
as best I&nbsp;can.</p>
<p>In October 2015,
I decided to start a more intentional&nbsp;transition</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In some ways that was the end of a long process
that began much earlier.
I had already dropped most attempts at presenting as a man.
My entire life was a transition,
and that day marked the final,
public&nbsp;coming-out.</li>
<li>In some ways my transition has taken much of 2016 —
with hormone therapy,
documentation changes,
and learning to consciously identify as a woman.
That upheaval has calmed down quite a bit,
and you could say the process is complete.
I live my life now as a&nbsp;woman.</li>
<li>In some ways my transition will take a few more years,
as I settle into my new identities,
and the people around me settle in as well.
Hormonal changes can take up to five years,
and I&#8217;ll slowly become more comfortable
finding my place in a world that sees me&nbsp;differently.</li>
<li>In some ways my transition will last a life time.
I will always be on hormones,
I will always be transgender,
and I will always have family and friends
who remember me &#8220;before&#8221;
(their construct, not mine)
and have trouble putting those pieces&nbsp;together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our definitons of gender are tightly intertwined
with life experiences —
so gender will always be an ongoing process.
The longer I&#8217;m seen as a woman,
the more I will be seen as a&nbsp;woman.</p>
<p>Still, I was not born a man,
and have not &#8220;become&#8221; a woman in the last year.
I&#8217;m not a new or different person,
and there really was no chasm to cross over.
My gender has not changed at all —
only my social presentation
and hormone&nbsp;levels.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to see the body I expect in the mirror,
but transition has mostly been about changing
how other people see me.
I am not finally a woman,
but you are finally aware of my&nbsp;womanhood.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="confirmation-surgery">
<h2><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Confirmation&#8221;&nbsp;Surgery</h2>
<p>Transition is not a surgery,
and transgender is not a medical&nbsp;term.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Some trans people never transition at all,
for various valid reasons.
They are just as trans as I am,
and their genders are just as real as&nbsp;mine.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Many transition without medical intervention —
changing only pronouns, name,
or other aspects of social&nbsp;presentation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Some take hormones,
but have no interest in&nbsp;surgery.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Some take voice or movement lessons,
intentionally learning the cultural manerisms
that many women pick up without&nbsp;thinking.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Some get genital reconstruction,
or traceal shaves,
or facial changes,
or other medical&nbsp;procedures.</p>
<p>Surgery can be a useful way for some people
to relieve strong body dysphorias,
or blend in to avoid harassment —
but surgery is not central to transition
for&nbsp;everyone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>People regularly assume that my transition
has or will soon involve genital surgery.
Maybe. Maybe not.
But it&#8217;s a false assumption
that gender-transition is all about sex and genitals,
and the real measure of completion —
as though only surgery can make us
&#8220;real&#8221; men or &#8220;real&#8221;&nbsp;women.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not interested in surgery to make me a woman.
Women are not vaginas,
and men are not penises.
I might be interested
for my own relationship with my&nbsp;body.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="passing">
<h2><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Passing&#8221;</h2>
<p>Now that strangers correctly identify me as a woman,
people say that I am &#8220;passing&#8221;
in my &#8220;new&#8221;&nbsp;gender.</p>
<p>The language of passing is borrowed from racial politics
(light-skinned black people passing as white)
and gay/lesbian politics
(femme lesbians or butch gays passing as straight),
where &#8220;passing&#8221; means you &#8220;look like&#8221; something you are not.
Passing is often a complicated privilege —
making it possible for marginalized people
to avoid harassment and violence,
at the cost of rejecting or hiding their true identity,
and becoming invisible to their own&nbsp;communities.</p>
<p>That language is strange for trans people,
who are said to be &#8220;passing&#8221; when we are identified <em>correctly</em>
in our appropriate genders.
It doesn&#8217;t seem right to say that a woman
is &#8220;passing&#8221; as a woman.
That perpetuates some sense that trans people are fake,
or&nbsp;under-cover.</p>
<p>From that perspective,
&#8220;passing&#8221; seems like the entire point of transition.
I don&#8217;t want to be seen as a man,
so I will change my clothes to pass as a woman.
That&#8217;s clearly the assumption many people&nbsp;make.</p>
<p>It would be more accurate to say
I was previously &#8220;passing&#8221; as a man.
That&#8217;s when I was puttin in effort to present
as something I never understood.
Transition was about letting go of that persona,
not about putting on a new&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>I might also &#8220;pass&#8221; as cis-gender —
which would be more in-line with the meaning
in other communities.
When I pass,
my queer identities become&nbsp;invisible.</p>
<p>Even with that distinction,
there&#8217;s a common assumtion that trans people
are all &#8220;trying to pass&#8221; —
that passing is the entire purpose of transiton.
We&#8217;re often given un-solicited advice and critique
to help us <em>pass better</em>,
and trans people who are misgendered regularly
take the blame for &#8220;failing&#8221; in their&nbsp;transition.</p>
<p>But misgendering is something that happens
to cis and trans people alike.
When my nephews are misgendered,
we don&#8217;t give them advice on proper manly haircuts —
we correct the person who made the mistake.
Many people, cis and trans alike,
find it useful to conform to some stereotypes
in order to avoid mis-gendering harassment and violence.
That&#8217;s a survival strategy
we all have to consider —
not a special aspect of the trans&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care about &#8220;passing&#8221; as a woman or cis
(I was already a woman, and I&#8217;m proud to be trans)
but being correctly gendered without caveats
makes my life much easier every day.
I didn&#8217;t transition so that I would blend in,
and I don&#8217;t have any interest in hiding my transness —
but it&#8217;s hard to live with your gender
constantly called into question,
or the center of conversation.
I have the privilege of blending in when I need to,
and that helps to keep me&nbsp;safe.</p>
<p>Trans people face a real and constant threat of violence.
&#8220;Passing&#8221; as cis-gender <em>can</em> be important for us,
but it&#8217;s not a goal we all share,
and not the purpose of&nbsp;transition.</p>
