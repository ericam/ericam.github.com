<p><em>[Lights up. A bathroom surrounded by emptiness. Sam is in the bathroom &#8212;
alive and alone. There&#8217;s a band in the bathtub.
Everyone else in the emptiness, doing their thing.
Jenny and Jolene are dancing together, Herman doing his nails,
Edward cleaning, the Narrator watching.
Time can pass slowly outside&nbsp;the&nbsp;bathroom]</em></p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Make-up tutorial number 37:
creating the perfect brow or, as the kids say,
keeping your brows on fleek.
Shit, I don&#8217;t know if the kids say that anymore.
Doesn&#8217;t matter, doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;matter.&nbsp;Eyebrows.</p>
<p><em>[Staring into the mirror for a&nbsp;few&nbsp;beats…]</em></p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>&nbsp;Step&nbsp;one.</p>
<p><em>[Touching her brow, then running her finger down her face,
moving her nose around, smiling, grimacing, moving eyebrows up, down,&nbsp;in&nbsp;etc]</em></p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Step one… If only there were still a god of eyebrow grooming,
we could stop looking in the mirror,
sacrifice something small like a squirrel
because nobody likes them anyway and enjoy the rest of our day
with perfectly shaped eyebrows.
But we got rid of those gods,
the ones that meddled in every little thing…
doing crazy shit. Like there’s this young couple in a pool together &#8212;
male and female is the idea &#8212;
and the gods merge them into one being because she asks them to.
And then they&#8217;re sexless. Both sexes.
A creature of both sexes. Her, you know, breasts,
and probably eyebrows or whatever.
His… dangly bits. I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;know.</p>
<p><em>[Herman enters, looking for a&nbsp;nail&nbsp;file]</em></p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
The two of them &#8212;
the one of them &#8212;
looks back and curses the pool…
asks the gods to curse the pool, which of course they do.
So this cursed pool gets a reputation:
makes men effeminate or whatever,
because clearly it’s the man we’re talking about here.
Hermaphroditus, that’s his name.
It’s his myth, not hers,
and no man wants to get “womaned” out of the blue&nbsp;like&nbsp;that.</p>
<p><em>[Herman scoffs,&nbsp;and&nbsp;exits]</em></p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
He didn&#8217;t ask for it, she did!
But don&#8217;t blame her.
Don’t blame these poor kids in the middle of some traumatic gender shit,
blame the gods laughing at them. Like, come on! Have a little discretion.
You&#8217;re a god. Take it seriously!
Now you&#8217;ve got a cursed body of water.
Or blessed, really, depending on who you&#8217;re talking to.
Either way, some educated so-and-so comes along
like Vitruvius or someone and is all “fuck that” it’s just water.
Forget about the gods, we’ve got&nbsp;science&nbsp;now!</p>
<p><em>[She gets out a few&nbsp;pill&nbsp;bottles]</em></p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Who needs the gods when there’s all these pretty little pills?
Vitruvius didn’t say that, I did.
Science starts explaining away the god of this and the god of that…
until we&#8217;re left with just the one: the god of death.
That&#8217;s a tricky one… pills don’t seem to work on that one.
But let’s not get hung up on the ending…
sometimes that’s the least important part.
We’re not talking about death, we’re talking about bodies &#8212;
and it’s not like we’ve got the world all making-sense now in that arena.
It’s not like we can see what’s coming &#8212;
first this, then that, with logical causes and effects.
Things happen. Other things happen. We can&#8217;t explain it.
So, I guess, Step One: accept what your face looks like!
Or don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s not my problem.
On fleek or not, anything might happen.
So do what you want!
<em>[pause]</em> Come back somewhere between 15 months and never for&nbsp;step&nbsp;two.</p>
<p><em>[She takes&nbsp;a&nbsp;pill]</em></p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
There. See.&nbsp;All&nbsp;gone.</p>
<p><em>[Sam walks out of the bathroom.&nbsp;Time&nbsp;changes]</em></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<img alt="/static/pictures/art/theater/10myths/jenny-film.jpg" src="/static/pictures/art/theater/10myths/jenny-film.jpg" />
<p><em>[Sam is dead in her chair.
Someone takes a tape out of a box, puts it in the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">VCR</span></span> and presses play.
They all watch video of Sam undressing while they eat casserole.
Narrator walks into the bathroom.
They maybe start to prep for a shower,
pull open the shower curtain revealing the band,
get annoyed, and readjust their plan.
They groom in some way and talk into&nbsp;the&nbsp;mirror]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
It&#8217;s hard to say what happened first.
Was it the time I asked Herman what he meant with his life,
and he just laughed? We piled into his Volvo and drove west.
West, young queers!
Was it the time we decided to make crafts but only had macaroni and glitter &#8212;
no glue or paper or pipe cleaners &#8212;
so we just made a festive dinner with festive after effects?
There was glitter in the toilet for days.
Was it the time Sam told a story about the gods
hearing Salmacis scream out to please
let her never be parted from this beautiful boy she was assaulting,
and they listened, and merged the two into one form?
I have no clue. I have no clue what happened first.
Fuck it, I&#8217;d say sometimes it&#8217;s hard to even say what happened, period.
Memory&#8217;s a chaotic jerk. It&#8217;s all shuffle-y. But Sam happened.
I feel fairly confident about that. Mostly because other people would agree.
She found us young queers wandering west and collected us,
gave us strength in numbers.&nbsp;Sam&nbsp;happened.</p>
<p><em>[Narrator starts to unzip their pants. Herman opens&nbsp;the&nbsp;door]</em></p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Oh,&nbsp;sorry&nbsp;I&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
<em>[zipping back up]</em>&nbsp;It&#8217;s&nbsp;okay.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I should&nbsp;have&nbsp;knocked.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
It&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;matter.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;I&nbsp;wasn’t&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
It&#8217;s fine. Come in. Do whatever you need&nbsp;to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p><em>[Pause. Herman&nbsp;does&nbsp;nothing]</em></p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Beautiful outside. I was just out there and it&nbsp;was&nbsp;beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Warm, but not like the last couple days &#8212;
the humidity. Dry today. A dry heat, you know, but not hot, really.
Perfect for&nbsp;a&nbsp;walk.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;Mhhmm</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
The park looked empty. I just came past the park and it looked &#8212;
there was one couple there, eating I think it was ice-cream cones on a bench.
I couldn’t see them well, in the shade of those &#8212;
what are they &#8212;
the bigger trees they have there with all the shade,
and the&nbsp;benches&nbsp;underneath?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
It&#8217;s&nbsp;ok,&nbsp;Herman…</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Oh sure. Sorry to just, you know. I’ll let&nbsp;you&nbsp;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
No, I just &#8212;
Sorry. Sounds nice. <em>[pause]</em> I think they&#8217;re&nbsp;Cottonwood&nbsp;trees.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I&nbsp;love&nbsp;those.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
No. Ew, gross. Don&#8217;t love those. They fall over.
They are big and beautiful but they have small roots
so they fall over and die all the time.
That’s why they say in a storm never stand near a cottonwood…&nbsp;or&nbsp;something.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
What are you doing&nbsp;this&nbsp;evening?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Just going to bed.
I’m really, you know, up late the last couple of…
I could use&nbsp;the&nbsp;sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Right. Ok, sure.
I was thinking I might, you know, go for a walk or something.
It’s so nice&nbsp;out.&nbsp;Outside.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I&#8217;m&nbsp;sorry,&nbsp;Herman.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
No, you should sleep. We should&nbsp;all&nbsp;sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
No, I&#8217;m sorry&nbsp;you&#8217;re&nbsp;alone.</p>
<p><em>[They hold hands and keep trying to groom.
At some point they let go of each other&#8217;s hands.
And it&#8217;s easy to do. And that&#8217;s sad.&nbsp;Jenny&nbsp;enters]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Knock, knock. There&#8217;s room for more, right? What&#8217;s happening?
You two being gloomy or something? Try having a casserole.
I guess they&#8217;re supposed to help.
Seriously I&#8217;ve never seen so many casseroles in my life.
We should have a dance party. Not really.
It&#8217;s not great dancing on a full stomach.
Ooooo look. Chanel lipstick. Who&#8217;s is this? Number&nbsp;54.&nbsp;Boy.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
It’s&nbsp;called&nbsp;Boy?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
It&nbsp;looks&nbsp;mauve.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Who’s&nbsp;is&nbsp;this?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;Sam&#8217;s&nbsp;maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I bet&nbsp;it&nbsp;was.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I&nbsp;want&nbsp;some.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;Me&nbsp;too.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Wait your turn. Chanel lipstick. Not cheap my friends. Not cheap.
<em>[putting it on]</em> Make-up tutorial number 114.
Step 1: Apply lipstick in a criss-cross pattern at the cupid&#8217;s bow,
the outer corners and the bottom of&nbsp;the&nbsp;lip.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I never knew that part of the lip had&nbsp;a&nbsp;name.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Everything has a name.
Apply lipstick in the criss-cross pattern at the cupid’s&nbsp;bow,&nbsp;then…</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Then the outer corners and the bottom of&nbsp;the&nbsp;lip.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Ooo, I think it kind of looks good just&nbsp;like&nbsp;that.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
It doesn’t. Step 2: Working from the initial starting points,
use a &quot;connect-the-dots&quot; method to fill in the rest of&nbsp;the&nbsp;lips.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Lipstick is crazy. Makeup&nbsp;is&nbsp;crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
It’s fantastic. Nothing wrong with a&nbsp;little&nbsp;makeup.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
No, I know. It’s just strange.
Pinching your cheeks and putting color on your lips
and bat shit on your eyelashes that you curl. It’s&nbsp;really&nbsp;weird.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;Bat&nbsp;shit?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
It was on some tv show. The guy was an animal exterminator or something,
and he went to this house that was infested with bats,
and he stepped in bat shit,
and then he said something about how they use bat shit to&nbsp;make&nbsp;mascara.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;They&nbsp;don’t.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
“Yes ladies, mascara”! That’s what&nbsp;he&nbsp;said.</p>
<p><em>[Pause]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Jesus,&nbsp;I&#8217;m&nbsp;sad.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
For sure. <em>[beat]</em>&nbsp;Next&nbsp;step.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Ah, last but not least, Step 3:
Blot lips and apply one final layer&nbsp;of&nbsp;lipstick.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Why do we have&nbsp;to&nbsp;blot?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
To get an even texture before we put on the&nbsp;final&nbsp;layer.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
And some people do this. <em>[pulls finger though lips]</em>
So you don’t get it on&nbsp;your&nbsp;teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Who said we don’t like lipstick on&nbsp;our&nbsp;teeth?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Our teeth should be white and perfect.
We want what we are born with. Perfect&nbsp;white&nbsp;teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Baby’s don’t&nbsp;wear&nbsp;lipstick.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
More to the point, babies don&#8217;t have teeth.
And none of their lips are naturally&nbsp;this&nbsp;color.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Boy. Boy is&nbsp;the&nbsp;color.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;That’s&nbsp;right.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
That’s&nbsp;weird&nbsp;too.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Absolutely. What is it supposed&nbsp;to&nbsp;mean?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
<em>[looking in mirror, exaggerating lips]</em>
Boy. Boy. Boooy. We look like&nbsp;boys&nbsp;now.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I&#8217;m a&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;boy.</p>
<p><em>[Herman leaves. Jenny starts looking at herself,
poking at her body, sucking in&nbsp;her&nbsp;stomach]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
There&#8217;s important stuff in there, you know.
They say that if a Barbie were person-sized,
there wouldn&#8217;t be enough room for all her guts.
She&#8217;d have only a few inches of intestine and half&nbsp;a&nbsp;liver.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
And the liver regenerates so that would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
That would be the problem?
No, the problem is that there&#8217;s only room for half&nbsp;of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Right. And the other half is going to try to jam itself in&nbsp;there&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">OK</span></span>, but the real point is she can&#8217;t survive.
Look, let&#8217;s say that she has her whole liver,
but then she doesn&#8217;t have either of her kidneys or her,
like, I don&#8217;t know, spleen or some shit.
So she&#8217;s not alive and that&#8217;s the point,
but even if she were alive,
she would have to walk on all fours
and wouldn&#8217;t be able to hold up her enormous head on her fragile&nbsp;little&nbsp;neck.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;monster.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Yes.&nbsp;A&nbsp;monster.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
A beautiful,&nbsp;beautiful&nbsp;monster.</p>
<p><em>[Jenny exits. Narrator has needed to pee for so long now. What a relief.

<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Ahhh! Shit! A safety pin is far from safe when you&#8217;re only using one hand.
I think I&#8217;m bleeding. I am bleeding. Geez, I&#8217;m bleeding a lot.
More than is even possible from a stupid pin. Carnage…
Sam, would have liked this.
Who am I supposed to talk to about guts, and blood, and body parts?
About sacrifices to the gods…
and how pigs have organ systems very similar to humans…
so if the goal is to trick a god who isn&#8217;t paying much attention,
a pig might be the way to go.
Poor smart, sweet pigs with human-like hearts.
And here we are shoving them in our mouths,
giving ourselves coronary disease in our pig-like hearts…
from eating pig.
Oh! and weren&#8217;t you the one who told me about the Aztecs
collecting blood in little bowls…
from their ears, remember that?
You said they used to go home and collect blood in little bowls for the Gods.
Then you said, the Gods were seldom pleased.
<em>[pause, dealing with the finger]</em> I think it stopped…
Of course the Gods weren&#8217;t pleased… It&#8217;s not that much blood.
Collected in little bowls… What… they&#8217;d just prick their ears?
You&#8217;ve gotta go big. Like an arm… or a leg… your only son… some virgins…
<em>[pause, making some final adjustments]</em> I don&#8217;t know&nbsp;any&nbsp;virgins…</p>

Everyone is a dick. Are a dick. Everyone are? That’s not right.
People are dicks. The team is/are dicks? Politics is messy? Are messy.
I’m not British. I’ll never get it right.
<em>[beat]</em> Why are people flossing their teeth in the Walgreens parking lot?
Why do I have to side step used white plastic one-time teeth flossers
every time I get out of my car? The parking lot of Walgreens is a hell show.
Everyone is drunk. Or puffy-faced. Or both. There isn’t room for you.
It’s too much face. Stop taking up so much space. And stop coughing.
<em>[beat]</em> Ghosts are dicks. Just be dead.
Men wearing those Toms shoes that look like Hobbit ballet slippers.
That makes me so mad inside. <em>[beat]</em> 1 Derful Dave on Match.
You’re a dick. Don’t spell wonderful with the number 1.
You should know that when you first started emailing me
I didn’t notice the one and I just thought your name was Derful Dave
and that makes no fucking sense… Since when can’t we write whole words?
Since when can’t we say whole words? Totes? Yolo?
The world is ending because 8 million years ago we invented language
and now we’re here and it’s all wrong and God is pissed
or the Gods are pissed.
And when we all die,
nothing beautiful will be said about us because
no one will be left who knows how&nbsp;to&nbsp;talk.</p>
<p><em>[Jolene&nbsp;enters]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
You ready&nbsp;for&nbsp;this?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
My dog was a dick but he couldn’t help it. He barked at&nbsp;disabled&nbsp;people.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Sometimes animals are dicks because their owners&nbsp;are&nbsp;dicks.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Oh. I guess I&#8217;m the biggest&nbsp;dick,&nbsp;then.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Don&#8217;t bark at me, Sam. <em>[beat]</em> Are&nbsp;you&nbsp;ready?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>&nbsp;I&nbsp;am!</p>
<p><em>[Sam is giving Jolene a hair cut,&nbsp;with&nbsp;clippers]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Are you going to tell me&nbsp;a&nbsp;story?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>&nbsp;What&nbsp;story?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Anything.&nbsp;The&nbsp;usual?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Ok, yes! I was reading about the Aztecs.
Every September they would throw this big party
to celebrate the Corn Goddess Chicomeco…
something or other.
It’s probably bad luck not to be able to say her name,
but honestly I can’t remember it. It’s pretty long.
So everyone has to fast for, like,
seven days before the party gets started,
and a young slave girl, the prettiest around, is “sanctified”,
as in she gets dressed up as the Goddess Chicome-whatever.
<em>[regarding the haircut]</em> Is this even making a difference?
It looks&nbsp;the&nbsp;same.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Yeah. Look: minuscule little hair bits that Edward will bitch&nbsp;about&nbsp;later.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
No. Hair splinters.
They can imbed themselves under your skin and get infected.
Like they stick in you and your skin absorbs them and then freaks&nbsp;out.&nbsp;Infection.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
<em>[putting her hand on Sam’s face]</em> If I hold my finger here long enough,
will your skin&nbsp;absorb&nbsp;it?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
In theory, I&nbsp;think&nbsp;so.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
We could grow around each other.
It&#8217;s like the least romantic romantic-like thing.
But back to the&nbsp;slave&nbsp;girl.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Ok, so they take the slave girl from house to house
all over town and she dances for everyone…
trying to cheer the people up cuz they’re tired, hungry,
and depressed&nbsp;from&nbsp;fasting.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Does it work? Dancing slaves don&#8217;t cheer&nbsp;me&nbsp;up.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
That&#8217;s just the beginning.
In the evening everyone gets together at the temple
and they decorate one of those boxes that people are carried around in,
you know the ones with&nbsp;the&nbsp;poles…</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;palanquin?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
I don’t know… what’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;palanquin?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
It’s a box with poles that a person can be carried&nbsp;around&nbsp;in…</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Ok, then, yes. And there&#8217;s a huge to-do and everyone goes crazy,
crying, singing, praying, generally giving thanks for the fruits of the earth,
and the abundant crops that the Goddess bestowed on the people&nbsp;that&nbsp;year.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Is this&nbsp;going&nbsp;somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
You have somewhere&nbsp;to&nbsp;be?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>&nbsp;Go&nbsp;on.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Do you want to tell me&nbsp;a&nbsp;story?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>&nbsp;No.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Maybe tell me again about how you met Jenny?
How she bagged your groceries and that&#8217;s disappointingly not&nbsp;a&nbsp;euphemism?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Aztecs! Go back to the Aztecs! More ritual slave&nbsp;dances,&nbsp;please!</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Ok. They lead the virgin out of the temple so she can get some sleep.
But everyone else stays up and keeps watch.
When the sun comes up, they bring the virgin back and one by one,
the men first, followed by the women,
they kneel before the dressed up virgin &#8212;
and make a blood offering. I should back up quick.
During the seven days of fasting all the people in town
collect blood in little bowls, usually from their ears.
So now, when they’re kneeling before the virgin,
they can scrape all the blood they’ve collected out of the little bowl
and make an offering.
Gods partially appeased, everyone heads home, happy, to finally eat&nbsp;and&nbsp;rest.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Oh. That&#8217;s much more harmless than I thought it was going&nbsp;to&nbsp;be.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
There&#8217;s a little more. I think you are done, by&nbsp;the&nbsp;way.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">OK</span></span>, well, I want to hear&nbsp;the&nbsp;end.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Right. So everyone assembles back in the temple,
where the virgin is laid on her back, and they slice her head off.
Then a priest flays the headless body, dresses himself in the skin,
and leads a procession out of the temple singing and dancing
as jauntily as possible, considering he’s a grown man
jammed into skin that doesn’t&nbsp;fit&nbsp;him.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>&nbsp;Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
That&#8217;s what happens when you want to hear&nbsp;the&nbsp;end.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks&nbsp;Sam.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
You&#8217;re welcome. <em>[brushing hairs off of Jolene]</em>
Don&#8217;t let any of it get under&nbsp;your&nbsp;skin.</p>
<p><em>[Sam&nbsp;exits]</em></p>

<em>[as she&#8217;s leaving]</em>&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">YOLO</span></span>.</p>
<p><em>[Sam starts dressing/undressing.

<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;Suave,&nbsp;sir.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks,&nbsp;man.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Did you clean&nbsp;up&nbsp;after?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Of course we did. You shouldn&#8217;t go in there. Sam&#8217;s in&nbsp;the&nbsp;tub.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
<em>[to &quot;Sam&quot; after Jolene has gone]</em>
You know what I think?
I think Jolene cut off her own arm because she knew it wasn’t really hers.
<em>[pause]</em> Right? Like, you look down and think that’s your arm,
but she looked down and thought get the fuck off me.
And then eventually it did. With, like, a saws-all or something.
I don&#8217;t know. <em>[pause]</em>
Why do we spend the majority of our lives on the toilet,
and act like it never happened? <em>[pause]</em>
Why do we eat eggplant and pretend it’s good? <em>[pause]</em>&nbsp;Helllloo?</p>
<p><em>[Herman&nbsp;enters]</em></p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Sam&nbsp;in&nbsp;here?</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
She&#8217;s been in the tub&nbsp;for&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;Sam?</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
She does it all the time &#8212;
drains a little every so often and puts in more hot,
but that never really works. It must be freezing.
<em>[louder]</em> It must be freezing!
I don&#8217;t know why anyone would sit in the bath for hours!
<em>[back to normal volume]</em> Reading a book, probably.
Read it somewhere else, if you ask me. Somewhere none of us might want to be.
<em>[louder]</em> We all need to use&nbsp;the&nbsp;bathroom!</p>
<p><em>[Herman pulls back the curtain, revealing&nbsp;the&nbsp;band]</em></p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
She&#8217;s not&nbsp;in&nbsp;here.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
<em>[looking]</em> Oh. I guess she got out. I wonder where she went.
<em>[beat]</em> Ok, look. I know it&#8217;s not “nice” to talk about other people.
I mean, to stand here and tell you things about someone else
as though their story belongs to me,
but I have a feeling you know about this by now anyway.
Sam films herself undressing&nbsp;for&nbsp;bed.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Yeah.&nbsp;Every&nbsp;day.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
I found the tapes in the basement &#8212;
all perfectly labeled. She&#8217;s got boxes of them, all the&nbsp;same&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;I&nbsp;know.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Oh? Sure. I said you would. Does everybody? Maybe.
Have you asked her why? Has anyone?
Mostly the things I do every day are the things that everyone does.
Like masturbate or eat a hearty breakfast,
breakfast being the most important meal of the day.
Masturbation is not actually very easy for me.
It takes a lot of visualization and I have trouble relaxing so that&#8217;s a thing.
Focus. Minor distractions are a problem.
So, as you can imagine, doing it daily is no small task.
The difference is that I am not collecting <span class="caps"><span class="caps">VHS</span></span> tapes in my basement,
hard evidence of my daily activity.
So you don&#8217;t know to think any differently of me,
unless someone tells you,
which I hope they don&#8217;t because it&#8217;s not nice to talk about&nbsp;other&nbsp;people.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Jesus Edward. I was just looking&nbsp;for&nbsp;Sam.</p>

<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Make-up Tutorial #14. <em>[struggling]</em> Don&#8217;t listen to me on the topic.
I&#8217;m shit at doing make-up.
I haven&#8217;t had the practice because people don&#8217;t think make-up is for everyone
and, I guess I went along with that.
My understanding of make-up is that
it has often had something to do with social status,
like when people made themselves more pale
to show that they were people of leisure, indoor people, upperclass people.
And like when blush and certain shades of nail polish meant you were, like,
loose or something.
And like how today it still means enough about you
that I have trouble putting it on.
I want to but, I&#8217;m not interested in “making a statement”
or being a “pioneer”.
Which is laughable anyway because I&#8217;d hardly be among the first…
anyway, I would like to look a certain way without being noticed.
And I don&#8217;t know whether that makes sense because
why would I want to look anything if other people aren&#8217;t seeing me,
like how can I look anything if… fuck, I don&#8217;t know.
I guess just put on make-up how you want to. Or don&#8217;t.
It&#8217;s up to you. Or other people. Or something.
<em>[to the band]</em> Goddam it.
I&#8217;d like to take a bath! How is anyone supposed to deal&nbsp;with&nbsp;this?</p>

<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;Where&#8217;s&nbsp;Sam?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>&nbsp;With&nbsp;Herman.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Hopefully working on&nbsp;their&nbsp;coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
They&#8217;re not&nbsp;that&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
They look good. I mean it worked out. Or something.
Maybe that&#8217;s not the right way to say it.
This is my only first-hand experience with people, you know…
I mean, what do you even call it? Merging or absorbing or something?
But the point is that they look good.
Sam&#8217;s eyes have always been striking, Herman&#8217;s legs shapely…
Put them, you know <em>[gestures merging]</em>…
Anyway, they look good,
but you have to admit their coordination is all sorts of fucked up.
He sits while she stands, or the other&nbsp;way&nbsp;around.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
They&#8217;ll figure it out.
I think it’s nice because you can sit alone with one,
but if you’d rather have the other beside you, there she is.
I bet it feels good too. Do you think they feel bigger
all pushed together like that? Do you think they feel like one big person?
Sometimes I reach my hands up as far as they will go just to&nbsp;feel&nbsp;huge.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Does&nbsp;it&nbsp;work?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
No. My body takes up only a certain amount of space,
no matter how I organize it. But I&#8217;ll still do it.
Like, often. And every time I&#8217;m disappointed. Plus it makes me&nbsp;feel&nbsp;crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
I feel crazy a lot. Like most days I feel like I still have my arm.
Like I have two&nbsp;full&nbsp;arms.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
That&#8217;s not that crazy. I sometimes feel that&nbsp;way&nbsp;too.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
You do have two&nbsp;full&nbsp;arms.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I mean I sometimes feel like you have two&nbsp;full&nbsp;arms.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Oh.&nbsp;That&#8217;s&nbsp;weird.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
But I also feel like I have two arms. I’ve&nbsp;felt&nbsp;that.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
There are things that I do that are crazy by my own standards.
Is&nbsp;that&nbsp;normal?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Nothing is “normal” sweetie. There is no “not normal.” That&#8217;s not&nbsp;a&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p><em>[Herman/Sam&nbsp;enters]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
But you know what I mean, right? Do you do that?
I mean, what is something you do that even you think&nbsp;is&nbsp;crazy?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I lock eyes with every animal I meet. I started with pets, mostly.
But now humans. And, of course, wild animals if it is ever possible.
But you have to be sneaky to get close. You have to be careful.
And you have to be ready for any reaction.
You can&#8217;t know how anyone or anything might feel
when you look right in its damn eyes. I&#8217;ve been&nbsp;punched&nbsp;twice.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
<em>[to Jenny]</em> This person here: not normal.
And you want this person to make up half of our child&#8217;s&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">DNA</span></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Herman&#8217;s perfect for it. I don&#8217;t know about the Sam half of&nbsp;the&nbsp;equation.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Ha ha. <em>[she flips&nbsp;Jenny&nbsp;off)]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
<em>[to Herman/Sam]</em> We were just talking&nbsp;about&nbsp;you.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I hope you weren&#8217;t making fun of&nbsp;our&nbsp;coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>&nbsp;Obviously&nbsp;not.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Has anyone seen any tweezers?
<em>[or whatever makes a good activity&nbsp;for&nbsp;Herman/Sam]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Hold on. I think I saw some&nbsp;in&nbsp;here.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
It&#8217;s a&nbsp;learning&nbsp;curve.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I bet. I like it.
Is it terrible to say that it makes me feel a little special,
having friends that became one? Like it raised all of our exotic factor.
Is that a gross thing&nbsp;to&nbsp;say?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I meant it&#8217;s a learning curve sharing one bathroom with so&nbsp;many&nbsp;people.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
It&#8217;s a learning curve for some, for others we were born that way.
There were seven in my family sharing one, but so much worse then
because everybody needed their privacy. Bathrooms were for privacy.
As though something unknowable was happening on the other side of the door.
Granted, it really was the only&nbsp;private&nbsp;space.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I&#8217;d have had a hard time with this during my&nbsp;awkward&nbsp;years.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
You&#8217;re out of your awkward&nbsp;years?&nbsp;Lucky.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Clearly, we&#8217;re out of our awkward years. Nothing awkward&nbsp;about&nbsp;this.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Everyone knows what&nbsp;I&nbsp;meant.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
You&#8217;d have gotten used to it. Or not have known any different.
You might see something else on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TV</span></span>,
but that&#8217;s so clearly some bit of make-believe that <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TV</span></span> people create
like happy marriages and people who like to make homemade tomato sauce
from their freshly-picked garden-grown&nbsp;heirloom&nbsp;tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I would like to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>&nbsp;That&#8217;s&nbsp;nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Food you pick yourself tastes better.
Well, you don&#8217;t have to actually pick it yourself.
I mean, fresh food. Stuff from&nbsp;the&nbsp;garden.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
I never had a garden. I had&nbsp;parking&nbsp;lots.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
<em>[drops a pill]</em>&nbsp;Ugh.&nbsp;Dammit.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Could someone grab those&nbsp;for&nbsp;me?</p>
<p><em>[Someone does. They&nbsp;take&nbsp;it]</em></p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Are&nbsp;we&nbsp;okay?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>&nbsp;Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
What&nbsp;is&nbsp;this?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;Soap.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Well, yeah, I can see it&#8217;s soap. But what&#8217;s the purpose? Who put it in here?
I know this is what people do, but I don’t get it. This is real soap.
Real usable soap. But are people supposed to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;know.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
The weird thing is it’s all the&nbsp;same&nbsp;flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;What?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
The soap. They all look different but they are all the&nbsp;same&nbsp;flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Herman&#8217;s right. This one is a seashell and is purple and this one is a…
I don’t know what this one is… a fish?
Whatever, it’s a fish and it’s pink.
But they both smell the same. It’s the same soap,
just a different color and shape.
If you&#8217;re going to bother to have a pile of soap to choose from,
they should all&nbsp;be&nbsp;different.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I guess I don’t think you are supposed to use&nbsp;that&nbsp;soap.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>&nbsp;Why?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Because there is some soap right there. Like actually by&nbsp;the&nbsp;sink.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Who put it here? A pile of real soap that is not to be used as soap
but is just to be there as a pile&nbsp;of&nbsp;soap.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;For&nbsp;decoration.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
I put&nbsp;it&nbsp;there.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;For&nbsp;decoration?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
An offering of sorts. An offering to&nbsp;the&nbsp;bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
But&nbsp;for&nbsp;decoration?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
It&#8217;s&nbsp;an&nbsp;offering.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
There should be a pile of real seashells
if you want to have something decorative in your real bathroom.
I’m going to use it&nbsp;as&nbsp;soap.</p>

<p><em>[Sam shrugs. She&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;know]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>

<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Soap&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;spoil?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I can’t imagine&nbsp;it&nbsp;does.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>&nbsp;Everything&nbsp;spoils.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Do you make &#8216;offerings&#8217; all the time?
Because tons of stuff just appears&nbsp;in&nbsp;here.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
You shouldn&#8217;t look&nbsp;through&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
The soap pile is sitting on the back of the toilet. That&#8217;s a&nbsp;public&nbsp;arena.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Well, speaking broadly, the shit one keeps in the bathroom&nbsp;is&nbsp;private.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Not as private as what you keep under your bed or in your&nbsp;sock&nbsp;drawer.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>

<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
No one keeps their dead bodies in&nbsp;the&nbsp;bathroom.</p>

Is anyone else having&nbsp;trouble&nbsp;breathing?</p>
<p><em>[Beat]</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Seriously though, no one keeps their dead bodies in the bathroom.
They keep them under their bed, or buried in the garden.
Do you guys ever have that dream where you are burying bodies
of people that you’ve killed in your yard?
Or you remember about the dead bodies that you’ve buried
and&nbsp;you&#8217;re&nbsp;embarrassed?’</p>
<p><strong>All:</strong>&nbsp;No.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;Really?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Of course I’ve dreamt I killed people, I&#8217;ve just never&nbsp;buried&nbsp;them.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>

<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
<em>[still going through a drawer]</em> An <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EPT</span></span>&nbsp;Fertility&nbsp;Test…</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Ok, that’s kinda&nbsp;of&nbsp;private.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
No, not really…&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;mine.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;It&nbsp;is?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Yep, I thought in light of Jenny and Jolene asking,
I’d check to see if I&nbsp;was&nbsp;viable.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;Private!</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
It&#8217;s&nbsp;not&nbsp;private.</p>

<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;Well.…</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;Knew&nbsp;what?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
They want&nbsp;Herman’s&nbsp;sperm.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>

<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
You&#8217;re having&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby?</p>
<p><em>[Jenny and Jolene answer at the&nbsp;same&nbsp;time:]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
We want to. / <strong>Jenny:</strong>
We&#8217;re thinking&nbsp;about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Wow. I had&nbsp;no&nbsp;idea…</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
We want to. / <strong>Jenny:</strong>
We&#8217;re thinking&nbsp;about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Before we get too far along it seemed like a home test
would be a cheap and easy way to determine if I can do what&nbsp;you&nbsp;need.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
You’re gonna donate sperm? Can you still&nbsp;do&nbsp;that…</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>&nbsp;Good&nbsp;question.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Let me see that. So what…this is a pregnancy test&nbsp;for&nbsp;guys?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Fertility test. It determines sperm count.
A healthy &quot;male&quot; is supposed to have like 20 million sperm per…
I&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;remember…</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Per millimeter… 20 million sperm per millimeter is what&nbsp;it&nbsp;says.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Yikes, that’s a lot&nbsp;of&nbsp;sperm!</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
I have healthy sperm. You want me to test mine?
It looks like you just masturbate into a cup and then mix some testing fluid…
it doesn&#8217;t look hard…oh great and it comes with gloves! Nice and neat.
It’s like a fun science experiment.
<em>[pause]</em> Masturbation isn&#8217;t always easy, but I do it almost every day…
sometimes right into&nbsp;the&nbsp;sink.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Oh&nbsp;my&nbsp;God.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Don’t worry, I clean up right after…
I don’t really like to see myself in the mirror though.
I make this face that totally ruins it…
lately I’ve been picturing Herman watching Sam.
It seems to work…
but if I’m looking in the mirror it’s like watching myself
picturing Herman watching Sam. It gets&nbsp;too&nbsp;complicated.</p>
<p><em>[Awkward&nbsp;pause]</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
But&nbsp;that&#8217;s&nbsp;private.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
No, that&#8217;s wonderful! <em>[finding an eyelash curler]</em> Now this&nbsp;is&nbsp;private.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Yes! Exposing all the mechanisms used to make you look beautiful.
That&#8217;s&nbsp;nobody&#8217;s&nbsp;business.</p>
<p><em>[They all start to leave talking,&nbsp;except&nbsp;Edward]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
<em>[the last one out]</em> We&#8217;ll just leave you to do&nbsp;your&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
I&#8217;m not going to… <em>[looking around at the mess]</em> Hey! Nobody cleans?
Do they wonder how it gets clean? Do they pray to the Gods
and find that the Gods have answered. The fucking toilet is clean.
You&#8217;re welcome. I did it in between shipwrecking someone
and turning someone else into a statue or a lizard or something.
There probably is a god of hygiene or bathrooms.
Hey, band, can I have some&nbsp;praying&nbsp;music?</p>
<p><em>[The band plays Amazing Grace&nbsp;or&nbsp;something]</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Take each layer, oh God &#8212;
whatever weird name you may have &#8212;
and peel it clean. Remove the dust and the little fucking hairs.
Take out the trash when it runneth over.
You are mighty and I praise you,
several times a week at the foot of this multi-use throne… Altar?
This porcelain altar? I&#8217;ll say whatever to get you to… do&nbsp;your&nbsp;thing…</p>
<p><em>[Narrator enters&nbsp;mid&nbsp;prayer]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>

<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Kind of… though it feels more&nbsp;like&nbsp;atonement.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Huh. <em>[flossing teeth]</em>
God keeps all the bone of the righteous, so that none of them&nbsp;are&nbsp;broken.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
The god&nbsp;of&nbsp;what?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Are&nbsp;teeth&nbsp;bones?</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;No.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
You&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;know.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
They’re enamel and like tissue and shit… No one ever&nbsp;cleans&nbsp;this.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Because you clean it. <em>[pause]</em>
If they’re not bones then why do you always see them on skeletons?
<em>[pause]</em> My seventh grade health teacher, Ms. Kellogg,
had a skeleton in the corner and it had teeth.
Bones and teeth… I think&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;bones.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
They’re harder&nbsp;than&nbsp;bones.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Well they’re still around with the bones so you gotta take care of them.
<em>[beat]</em> My Mom kept all my baby teeth in a bottle. I found&nbsp;it&nbsp;once.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Gross and… love. I don’t think the skeleton was real.
The one in the corner of your classroom. There&#8217;s no way it&nbsp;was&nbsp;real.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Yeah, probably not. I don’t remember. Maybe there wasn’t a skeleton at all…
but she did teach seventh&nbsp;grade&nbsp;health…</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Well, if it was there, it&nbsp;wasn&#8217;t&nbsp;real.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
We put condoms on bananas… I&nbsp;remember&nbsp;that.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
A&nbsp;useful&nbsp;skill.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>

because all you need to satisfy a woman is the first&nbsp;four&nbsp;inches.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>

<p><em>[Herman/Sam&nbsp;enter]</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Oh, hey! How did Jolene lose&nbsp;her&nbsp;arm?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I don&#8217;t&nbsp;know.&nbsp;Why?</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Sam said Jolene was in the war and doesn’t like to talk about it &#8212;
lost her arm to an&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">IUD</span></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">IED</span></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;What?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
<em>[laughing]</em> How many soldiers lose their arms to birth-control?
I heard Jolene was conjoined at birth &#8212;
twin sisters sharing an elbow from two upper-arms.
After surgery, one or both were put up for adoption,
and somewhere in the world a second Jolene got the long end of&nbsp;the&nbsp;straw.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Jenny said Jolene and her sister were out on a frozen river
with their friends from high school &#8212;
oh! Like a wishbone! <em>[beat]</em>
Anyway, some kid, Paco, starts jumping on a dark spot &#8212;
thinks he&#8217;s funny, but goes right through &#8212;
and Jolene is the only one with balls enough to save him.
Lost her arm to frostbite.
She&#8217;s probably a hero in south Nebraska or wherever.
I think Jolene cut it off herself. Because it didn&#8217;t feel like hers.
Xenomelia. WebMD! It&#8217;s like xenophobia, but&nbsp;less…&nbsp;racist.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Is this all you think about? Why do you care so much?
You have so&nbsp;many&nbsp;stories.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
I&nbsp;don&#8217;t&nbsp;know.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Mythicize, you should look that up…
We&#8217;re trying to understand&nbsp;the&nbsp;situation.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I think Jolene was born without an arm. It&nbsp;happens,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;…Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
People look all sorts of ways.
I mean, when I look in the mirror, I sometimes can&#8217;t believe&nbsp;the&nbsp;shapes.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
I wish I could say the same. <em>[studying]</em>
My belly is dumpier than I would like.
My eyes are bloodshot, my hair thin.

It&#8217;s okay to wear eyeliner wherever you want to&nbsp;wear&nbsp;eyeliner.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
No, I know that. I mean. Will it be okay? Because of&nbsp;the&nbsp;crying.</p>

<p><em>[Herman and Sam merge, and everyone goes about&nbsp;their&nbsp;activities]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Sam had a fever, and Herman sat with her through the night,
and by morning they became one. That&#8217;s one story.
Others say it happened chopping onions for dinner,
when Sam slipped in a tad too close, and stuck. I don&#8217;t know.
People seem to agree that it was something mundane.
But that happens later,&nbsp;I&nbsp;think.</p>

<p><em>[Herman lets go. Sam&nbsp;is&nbsp;alone]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Still dressing and undressing for the camera &#8212;
trying to get it right. In any case, I woke up feeling like people &#8212;
all of us &#8212;
are made of complicated stuff. Too hard to understand or fix.
So I&#8217;m screwed because I am breaking down and unfixable.
And, to make matters worse, time is passing. Lots of it.
Because nobody has yet figured out how to stop it in such a crisis.
Someone should really get on that. So that&#8217;s the kind of morning it is.
And it took forever to pull pants on over my legs
because I didn&#8217;t understand what the fuck my legs even were.
It&#8217;s time I get a handle on this.
It&#8217;s time that there are no mornings like this.
I want to wake up knowing that it&#8217;s simple:
that I am made of tinfoil and paperclips.
So I took initiative and looked it up.
“What are people made of” I typed. And nothing is helpful.
Because we are apparently made of everything:
we are made of calcium, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen,
and phosphorus or body, mind, intellect, ego and soul or,
according to a Modest Mouse song, nothing but water and shit.
Or snips and snails, and puppy dogs tails if you identify as a little boy
or sugar and spice and all things nice if you identify as a little girl
which makes it ten times more complicated
because now I am required to think of myself as
something more specific than just a people &#8212;
I mean, a person. <em>[beat]</em>
Ha! A little boy, a little girl, a little people.

Make-up tutorial #128: For just a moment,
things improve if you wash your face after you&#8217;ve been crying.
<em>[wiping face]</em> A face wipe or water, it doesn&#8217;t really matter.
You know the tightness of dried tears, and the run of your mascara?
Getting rid of those makes you feel better.
It might not last, but you will take what you can get, right?
<em>[pause, wipes face, wipes face again]</em> Sam thinks &#8212;
Sam thought &#8212;
baths cure everything.
Our femur could have been jutting out of our skin
and she would suggest taking a bath.
She couldn&#8217;t imagine a life without baths.
<em>[wipes face]</em> I never take baths anymore.
<em>[looks at the band, wipes face again]</em> We should’ve taken her around.
The family is requesting an open casket… can you make Sam look like Sam?
If you can’t make Sam look like Sam, you don’t get the job…
I don’t know who ended up doing it. Are they good at their job?
If that’s as good as that job can be done, it shouldn’t be anyone&#8217;s job.
Because in the end… it was very strange.
It’s like dressing up like yourself but getting it wrong.
Someone should do a make-up tutorial on that: Looking like you, but not.
Looking like weird dead made-up you. I guess the hands were right,
but I don’t know if anything is done to the hands besides placing them in a…
solemn position.
Why would the custom be to look at the body after it’s been dressed up
by someone who doesn’t know the body? I knew the body.
No one asked me to dress her up. <em>[pause]</em>
Funerals are such a creepy mix of dust-to-dust futility, wacky stories,
gross greener pastures bullshit,
and a fucking painted body in the corner that used to have a person inside.

<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;Canes&nbsp;Sepulchrale.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;What?</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
People used to breed dogs for the sole purpose of devouring human remains.
Bodies were put into open fields to be devoured by wild animals
and it was considered a bad omen if the body wasn’t devoured.
The opposite of covering things up and burying them.
Naked, open, evisceration.
The idea was that if the wild animals ate the body,
your loved ones live on in the animal… a sort of living sepulcher…
hence the carefully trained dogs…
in case the wild beast thing didn’t work out…
the soul should have a strong and lusty frame to dwell in.
<em>[pause]</em> Then again, dogs like to bury things…
so maybe the ancient people got&nbsp;it&nbsp;wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Water is good&nbsp;for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I&nbsp;know&nbsp;that.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Water is, like, the reason we&#8217;re alive&nbsp;or&nbsp;something.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;I&nbsp;know.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
So maybe you do need to drink some&nbsp;fucking&nbsp;water.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Is there&nbsp;any&nbsp;Pepto?</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Oh, if you need Pepto, you&#8217;re not feeling off.
You are specifically feeling either nausea,
heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach,&nbsp;or&nbsp;diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
No&nbsp;I’m&nbsp;not.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
You can have diarrhea in front of me.
It would take our relationship to the next level.
I can tell people,
this is my friend Herman and not only did Herman poop in front of me,
Herman&nbsp;had&nbsp;diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
That’s not a thing. I need you&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Because you are going&nbsp;to&nbsp;poop?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
No! No, I’m not going to poop, I just don’t want to talk to&nbsp;you&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
I’m just trying to help. I told you to drink&nbsp;some&nbsp;water!</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
That’s not being helpful, Edward! Of course I should drink some water!
Every single person should just go ahead and drink some fucking water,
but I don’t want to drink any fucking water.
<em>[beat]</em> I&#8217;m certainly not going to drink&nbsp;bathroom&nbsp;water.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;Bathroom&nbsp;water?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Water from the bathroom tap… It’s… It&#8217;s&nbsp;bathroom&nbsp;water.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
It&#8217;s the same water that&#8217;s in the rest of the house.
<em>[pause]</em> You know that right? There&#8217;s nothing wrong with it.
It&#8217;s not cursed or blessed or something.&nbsp;It&#8217;s&nbsp;water.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Please&nbsp;just&nbsp;go.</p>
<p><em>[Edward leaves the bathroom. Herman sits on the toilet. In&nbsp;comes&nbsp;Narrator]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Hey. Are you&nbsp;<span class="caps"><span class="caps">OK</span></span>?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I don’t&nbsp;feel&nbsp;good.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Did you drink&nbsp;some&nbsp;water?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>

<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;Not&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Well, get on it. You’ll feel right&nbsp;as&nbsp;rain.</p>
<p><em>[Herman&nbsp;exits]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
<em>[holding a bottle of pills]</em> These were Sam&#8217;s.
There are bits and pieces of Sam hanging around all over the place.
A shoe there. A bottle of pills here.
<em>[looking at the prescription label]</em> 30 tabs… one 10mg tab, once a day.
There are… five left. Huh… I may not be the only one taking these.
I remember going through a box of my mother’s things
and finding a little bottle… <em>[realization]</em>
it may have been a prescription bottle… that’s strange…
I can’t remember what she would have been taking… full of my teeth.
It was a shock. Those pieces of myself that I had traded in for money,
using an agreed upon game of make believe. Why did she keep them?
I mean first and foremost get rid of any evidence
that refutes a belief system you’re trying to put&nbsp;in&nbsp;place.</p>
<p><em>[Herman enters and stands in&nbsp;the&nbsp;doorway]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
That’s just basic…
but then I had to come to terms with all those little yellowed…
pieces of me… I mean I had already come to terms with the loss…
it’s a whole process… first the tooth is loose, right,
you wiggle it for days, it falls out, and then you tongue the hole…
obsessively. That’s how you come to terms with it being gone.
The hole takes shape. You understand it’s shape…
probably better than the missing tooth… and then to find them all again…
it’s traumatic. Pieces of yourself hanging around all over&nbsp;the&nbsp;place…</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
<em>[grabbing the glass of water and pouring it out]</em>
Cute explanation about missing teeth and loss.
The shape of something that’s not there.&nbsp;A&nbsp;metaphor?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
What are&nbsp;you&nbsp;doing?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Wouldn&#8217;t want to leave this just laying around &#8212;
just in case there&#8217;s something… I mean, it’s just water, but…
um, this is the toothbrush glass, so… gross.
<em>[exiting]</em> If Sam fell out, as you suggest,
was it to make room for something else coming in
or was she eaten up from the inside,
leaving an empty spot that can only be artificially filled?
<em>[pops his head back in]</em> I’m playing along, by the way…
with your tooth metaphor. It&#8217;s heavy-handed, but you&nbsp;started&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Now I can’t even remember what I was talking about. It wasn’t conscious…
the tooth metaphor. It wasn&#8217;t crafted.
I was just holding this bottle and that put me in mind
of the bottle of my baby teeth… It was organic. Herman made it weird.
That’s what Herman does. Shit! Now I’m going to do it: Sam was a molar.
Not an incisor, not small… larger… necessary, needed… for chewing.
Sam was a molar… This is goofy… K. I’m gonna take one of these.
Not because there’s anything wrong with me.
Because there was something wrong with Sam.

For sure. He&#8217;s not very&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;though.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
No. The internet has rarely provided me with someone interesting.

<p><strong>Herman:</strong>

<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Go for the cheap joke!&nbsp;Number&nbsp;69.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
<em>[Herman digs through drawers and finds a razor,

The important part is: even with only minutes,
you can get a quick grooming&nbsp;session&nbsp;in.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
But keep in mind, he probably won&#8217;t&nbsp;even&nbsp;notice.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
We do it to feel good about ourselves. To&nbsp;feel&nbsp;confident.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
How could we not be confident? Look at&nbsp;us!&nbsp;We&#8217;re…</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
A poly pandrogynous gender-fucked hairy femme with two&nbsp;people&nbsp;inside?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Not&nbsp;that&nbsp;hairy!</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
Hirsute is exactly how it sounds. Not from Latin or Olde English &#8212;
originated in some frat house or locker room when some guy was just like
“what do you call a hairy chick”
and some other dude was like “a her in a suit”. Hirsute.
A her suit made of hair. A hair suit. Hirsute.
I mean, no, that&#8217;s dumb, but either way, it’s onomatopoeia.&nbsp;Like&nbsp;love.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
That&#8217;s&nbsp;not&nbsp;onomatopoeia.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
I know, but kind of. It’s all lips and tongue and a big, open uh sound.
The same shape your mouth makes when you’re doing things to someone you love.
Imagine if that feeling was described with some totally different word,
like mucus or scab. I mucus you. I&nbsp;scab&nbsp;you.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
You&#8217;re nuts. I mucus you, scab you,&nbsp;love&nbsp;you.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong>
I love you too. And I love that love means so many things
and only one thing all&nbsp;at&nbsp;once.</p>

<p><em>[Jenny&nbsp;exits]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
What? I don&#8217;t know… <em>[putting on a mud mask]</em> Make-up tutorial #78.
You should put on a little mascara, they say. You&#8217;ll look so pretty.
It&#8217;ll make your eyes bright.
A little concealer can touch those blemishes right up.
A splash of blush, a smear of lipstick, they say. Huh. And you try.
You do try. I think you&#8217;d look better without all that makeup, they say.
I like the natural look. There&#8217;s no&nbsp;pleasing&nbsp;them.</p>
<p><em>[She starts to sing in the mirror.&nbsp;Edward&nbsp;interrupts]</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Can I ask you&nbsp;something&nbsp;Jolene?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
I bet you&nbsp;can,&nbsp;Edward.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Did you throw it? To win&nbsp;a&nbsp;race?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Did I&nbsp;throw&nbsp;what?</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Your… <em>[indicating arm]</em> Like the Red Hand of Ulster.
Has Sam told you that bit of gore?
The story goes that the kingdom of Ulster had no heir to the thrown
so they set up a boat race &#8212;
the first one to touch shore wears the crown.
So this slow bastard cuts off his hand and throws it, for&nbsp;the&nbsp;win.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Holy shit. He wasn&#8217;t going to&nbsp;win&nbsp;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
He wasn&#8217;t going to win so he flings his&nbsp;fucking&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
&#8212;

<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Touches the shore. The Red Hand&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ulster.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
<em>[gesturing]</em> It’s the Red Stump they should be&nbsp;worried&nbsp;about.</p>

<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Holy smokes, you&nbsp;scared&nbsp;me.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
How do&nbsp;I&nbsp;look?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Like you have mud on&nbsp;your&nbsp;face.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Bingo. It’s a treatment.
It’s mineral rich clay mud that was imported from the Aztec mountains
or something like that. It&#8217;s magic.
Edward thinks that I threw my hand onto a distant shore to win a race.
I don&#8217;t know what he thought I did with the rest of the arm,
but the bloody hand won me&nbsp;a&nbsp;race.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about, but good for you being&nbsp;a&nbsp;winner.</p>

<p><em>[They put it on without talking. They all three look in the mirror.

<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Ok, the story of Iphis&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ianthe.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;Finally!</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Iphis&#8217; father swore that he would kill his child if she was a girl
and so Iphis&#8217; mother hid her daughter&#8217;s gender from her husband,
raising Iphis as a boy. When Iphis was old enough to get married &#8212;
whatever that means &#8212;
her father arranged for his “son” to marry Ianthe.
Iphis instantly fell in love with Ianthe
but was conflicted about feeling that way about&nbsp;another&nbsp;woman.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Did Ianthe think Iphis was a&nbsp;man&nbsp;too?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Yes and she was also in love. So that&#8217;s nice,&nbsp;requited&nbsp;love.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Did they get to be with&nbsp;each&nbsp;other?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
It&#8217;s mythology, hon.
A god swooped in and just changed Iphis into a man on their&nbsp;wedding&nbsp;day.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Oh. Well, that&#8217;s convenient, I guess. I mean if that&#8217;s what Iphis wanted.
Being in a Greek myth is cheaper than hormones and surgery, that&#8217;s&nbsp;for&nbsp;sure.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Ahhh… It&#8217;s too dramatic for me. All the tragedy… the changes…
and on your wedding day. I try to avoid all the drama by staying on my knees…
groveling at&nbsp;the&nbsp;altar.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I meant to do some cleaning the&nbsp;other&nbsp;day.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;I&#8217;m&nbsp;sure.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
You do such a&nbsp;nice&nbsp;job.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
You do do such a nice job! HaHa! But Edward, beautiful man,
get up off your knees, the greek stuff isn&#8217;t about groveling,
it&#8217;s not about the Gods, it&#8217;s about you. I have a story for you too.
Do you know&nbsp;about&nbsp;Prometheus?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
Just&nbsp;say&nbsp;no.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;No…</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
So there&#8217;s a God, and he&#8217;s angry,
and he&#8217;s tormenting Prometheus, and in a&nbsp;terrible&nbsp;way…</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
More terrible than forcing him to perpetually clean&nbsp;the&nbsp;toilet?</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I&#8217;ve cleaned the&nbsp;toilet&nbsp;before!</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
The punishment isn&#8217;t important, what&#8217;s important is what Prometheus says…
you want to know what&nbsp;he&nbsp;says?</p>
<p><em>[Pause]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;Say&nbsp;yes!</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>&nbsp;Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Prometheus, chained, suffering, looks to the heavens and says, &#8216;Fuck off!
I care less than nothing for Zeus. Let him do what&nbsp;he&nbsp;likes&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
He said&nbsp;&#8216;fuck&nbsp;off&#8217;?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
No groveling from him. Cuz, the greek stuff wasn&#8217;t written by priests,
it was written by poets and that makes a huge difference.
The priests go and make things all god-y all the time.
Poets are happy to put people in the middle, flipping off the Gods.
What you&#8217;re doing Edward, on your knees, it&#8217;s&nbsp;too&nbsp;bible-y.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
It&#8217;s hard to take you seriously in a&nbsp;mud&nbsp;mask.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Then lets take&nbsp;em&nbsp;off!</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I think they&#8217;re supposed to stay on longer.
I mean if you want the full benefit of the&nbsp;Aztec&nbsp;mud.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Fuck the Aztecs, my&nbsp;face&nbsp;burns.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Fuck Zeus and fuck the Aztecs! Fuck the Gods and the poets they rode&nbsp;in&nbsp;on!</p>

<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Fused how? Never mind, I don’t need&nbsp;to&nbsp;hear…</p>

<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>

<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
Hairs can grow into your &#8212;
it doesn&#8217;t matter. We can grow&nbsp;around&nbsp;things.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
Yeah, her skin grew around the seat.
And when the paramedics came, they pried the seat off,
with the woman attached, and took them both to&nbsp;the&nbsp;hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
So the seat could&nbsp;be&nbsp;removed.</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
I think so… <em>[pause]</em> It wasn’t even her toilet. It was&nbsp;her&nbsp;boyfriend&#8217;s.</p>

Shit Herman,&nbsp;where&#8217;s&nbsp;Sam?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I don&#8217;t know. Her body&#8217;s in her room. All dressed, nowhere&nbsp;to&nbsp;go.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>&nbsp;Holy&nbsp;shit.</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
What do we&nbsp;do&nbsp;now?</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong>
<em>[grabbing the pile of soap]</em> Is this a thing?&nbsp;An&nbsp;offering?</p>
<p><strong>Jolene:</strong>
We need to&nbsp;call&nbsp;someone.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny:</strong>
I think people bring us casseroles that we eat for weeks&nbsp;or&nbsp;something.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Can I please just have&nbsp;some&nbsp;space?</p>
<p><em>[Jolene kisses Herman and exits with Jenny.
Edward hands Herman the soap and exits.
They grab the tapes still in Sam&#8217;s space and start&nbsp;watching&nbsp;them]</em></p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
<em>[looking at the band]</em> I&#8217;d watch out if I were you.
There might be something in the water &#8212;
it&#8217;s just one theory &#8212;
but the water could have something to do with it.
You know: two people merge into one and it&#8217;s amazing
but then someone dies and it&#8217;s emptier than ever.
I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s what happens. But it&#8217;s what happened.
Unbelievable is just one weird thing away from it happened.
Either way, your equipment could&nbsp;get&nbsp;ruined.</p>
<p><em>[Narrator&nbsp;enters]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I&#8217;m sorry, Herman. I have&nbsp;to&nbsp;pee.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;Ah,&nbsp;great.</p>
<p><em>[Herman takes a pill and rubs toothpaste all over the inside of&nbsp;their&nbsp;mouth]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
What are&nbsp;you&nbsp;doing?</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
These block dopamine from being reabsorbed,
so called re-uptake inhibitors… Ahhh! I love Colgate.
It has to be one of the big bad <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ADA</span></span> approved monsters, Crest, or Colgate…
and for me it’s the taste of Colgate that’s really just…
it’s the best… Wanna&nbsp;try&nbsp;some?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;No.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
And so mint toothpaste produces dopamine… toothpaste makes me happy…
and this keeps me happy… it’s a great combination… peanut butter&nbsp;and&nbsp;jelly.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
It&#8217;s&nbsp;happening&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Yeah, quick&nbsp;artificial&nbsp;happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I’d like to go to&nbsp;the&nbsp;bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I kinda have to go too. <em>[pause]</em> Sorry, ok you first.
I&#8217;ll wait right outside. <em>[starts to leave]</em>
Oh, let me grab this <em>[grabs the toothpaste]</em>. I might&nbsp;need&nbsp;more.</p>
<p><em>[Herman leaves but pops his head&nbsp;back&nbsp;in]</em></p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Pretty smart right? Interesting? Better living through science.
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter
and the idea with some of these antidepressants is that…
Ok wait… let me talk first about the&nbsp;Axon&nbsp;terminal…</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;Herman&nbsp;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Really there’s no compelling evidence
that the fucking pills work in the first place.
It’s like psychiatrists don’t know… doctors don’t know.
Is there a problem with your serotonin production?
Or, is there a myth perpetuated by drug companies
to tell you that there’s a problem with your serotonin production.
I haven’t gotten around to any clinical trials,
but I have found&nbsp;that&nbsp;toothpaste…</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;Please!</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
What’s wrong… you can’t go when I’m talking? You should try singing a song.
It’s supposed take your mind off having to pee in front of people.
<em>[pause]</em> Although, thinking of a song in front&nbsp;of&nbsp;people…</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Please…&nbsp;go&nbsp;away.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
I’ll just give you one. Then you don’t have to think of one… um…
give me a second… it’s harder than you might think… Oh!
Love in an Elevator. Everyone knows Aerosmith.
Ding. Second floor. Hardware, Children’s Ware, Ladies Lingerie.
Oh, good morning Mr. Tyler…
going… down… <em>[waits]</em>
going down… you’re supposed&nbsp;to&nbsp;sing!</p>
<p><em>[Herman sings, with&nbsp;the&nbsp;band:]</em></p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Working like a dog for the boss man. wo-oh.
Working for the company. wo-yeah.
Bettin’ on the dice I’m tossin’… wo-oh.
I’m gonna have a&nbsp;fantasy.&nbsp;wo-yeah…</p>
<p><em>[Herman stops singing, and cuts off&nbsp;the&nbsp;band]</em></p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
What&#8217;s wrong? You don’t know the song? You could just skip to&nbsp;the&nbsp;chorus.</p>
<p><em>[Herman sings, with&nbsp;the&nbsp;band:]</em></p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Love in an elevator, living it up when I’m going down.
Love in an elevator… <em>[stops again]</em> Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;helping?</p>
<p><em>[Narrator gives up and opens the door all&nbsp;the&nbsp;way]</em></p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>
Everyone pees. It’s a natural human process.
Nothing to be embarrassed about.
Here, maybe if you hear it, it’ll help.
<em>[silence as Herman pees]</em> Did you&nbsp;hear&nbsp;that?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Herman:</strong>&nbsp;You&#8217;re&nbsp;welcome.</p>
<p><em>[Herman&nbsp;exits]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
<em>[sitting on the toilet]</em> Make-up tutorial number 157:
Everyone pees. It&#8217;s a natural human process.
It doesn&#8217;t require some tutorial. Babies do it all the time…
I don&#8217;t know. Sam would have had something to say about it.
Maybe there&#8217;s a myth about peeing, and how the gods cursed us &#8212;
or blessed us, if that&#8217;s your thing? &#8212;
with a sewer system connected to our sexy bits… I&nbsp;don&#8217;t&nbsp;know.</p>
