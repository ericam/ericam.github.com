<p>The twin notions of microcosm and macrocosm neatly model the dominant
orienting lens of Western thought. From the pre-Socratics on, thinkers
who contend that they have discovered cosmological truths argue that
man is a little world embodying the structure and traits of the
greater universe. To know the universe, they say, look carefully at
man, and all truth shall be revealed. As man breathes, so does the
universe (Pythagoras). As man fights interior battles between good and
evil, so they must exist on a grander scale (Sir Thomas Browne). And
to affix such a connection: a maker to make cunningly. And so on&nbsp;it&nbsp;goes.</p>
<p><em>other voices and texts join in
they are hitler and groucho marx
and the scum manifesto and tweets
and status update blog post personal diary
literature&nbsp;and&nbsp;everything:</em></p>
<p>Concentric circles in the mind. Interior in conversation with the
exterior (or the inverse), and again and again we are re-creating what
we know most intimately: cyclical motions from the smallest to the
largest scale. Cycles of our hours, our days, the circular motion of
my hand in the air is a mirror to this cycle of All We Have: aka life
(unless we subscribe to the promise of After. Life. And isn&#8217;t this
promise of Something HereAfter so much of what brings us back,
circling back, week after week, to the Pew, the Alter, the Psalm, the
Incense and the Water, Genuflection at His feet? The promise that, if
we do this right, are appropriately sorrygood, then this is all just
the white-walled waiting room, the cloak room to the AfterLife that
counts?) . Creatures of habit, we find our pattern, conscious of
duplication&nbsp;or&nbsp;un-.</p>
<p><em>the voices come and go
forming patterns and rhythms
fighting and joining
soloing at times
and fighting with and against the music
in rhythms and sudden bursts
and building to&nbsp;a&nbsp;unison:</em></p>
<p>Should enemies strike our country, they would be attempting to shift
our attention with panic and weaken our morale with fear. In this,
they would fail. No act of theirs can alter the course or shake the
resolve of this country. We are a peaceful people - yet we&#8217;re not a
fragile people, and we will not be intimidated by thugs and killers.
If our enemies dare to strike us, they and all who have aided them,
will face&nbsp;fearful&nbsp;consequences.</p>
<p>We are now acting because the risks of inaction would be far greater.
In one year, or five years, the power of our enemies to inflict harm
on all free nations would be multiplied many times over. With these
capabilities, the dark one and his terrorist allies could choose the
moment of deadly conflict when they are strongest. We choose to meet
that threat now, where it arises, before it can appear suddenly in our
skies&nbsp;and&nbsp;cities.</p>
<p>The cause of peace requires all free nations to recognize new and
undeniable realities. In the 20th century, some chose to appease
murderous dictators, whose threats were allowed to grow into genocide
and global war. In this century, when evil men plot chemical,
biological and nuclear terror, a policy of appeasement could bring
destruction of a kind never before seen on&nbsp;this&nbsp;earth.</p>
<p>Terrorists and terror states do not reveal these threats with fair
notice, in formal declarations - and responding to such enemies only
after they have struck first is not self-defense, it is suicide. The
security of the world requires disarming The Old&nbsp;Serpent&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>As we enforce the just demands of the world, we will also honor the
deepest commitments of our country. Unlike the Author of Evil, we believe
the forgotten people are deserving and capable of human liberty. And when
the dictator has departed, they can set an example to all humanity of a vital
and peaceful and&nbsp;self-governing&nbsp;nation.</p>
<p>The United States, with other countries, will work to advance liberty
and peace in that region. Our goal will not be achieved overnight, but
it can come over time. The power and appeal of human liberty is felt
in every life and every land. And the greatest power of freedom is to
overcome hatred and violence, and turn the creative gifts of men and
women to the pursuits&nbsp;of&nbsp;peace.</p>
<p>That is the future we choose. Free nations have a duty to defend our
people by uniting against the violent. And tonight, as we have done
before, America and our allies accept&nbsp;that&nbsp;responsibility.</p>
<p>Good night, and may God continue to&nbsp;bless&nbsp;America.</p>

<p><em>while in&nbsp;the&nbsp;bathtub:</em></p>
<p>every day I cut back the rust

after the workday
I scrub at my hands until they grow old

<p>I passed the room where I got my first blow-job
the day I stopped going to church
the bathroom I took my first pill
the rundown church where the holy spirit entered me
the airport I left for Africa
the street I first got mugged
the theater where I lost feeling
for the first time
to when I was eight
and lived on a street with fuschia bushes
and snail-slicked paths
and football outside everyday
and, you know,
it never would have crossed my mind
there as an eight year old child
that I&#8217;d ever even make it to 29
and be a man who stood 6&#8216;2 and 300 lbs
with a shaved head and childish lips
who lived a mile above sea level and laid naked with women
and didn&#8217;t believe in god
who had felt the pentecost
believing in magic
sitting with homeless on iona road
reading bible verses at them
whose mind, heavy with stalagtites,
had, one day, just caved in.
but then, I suspect,
that no one ever ends where they expected
or is not horribly changed
by&nbsp;the&nbsp;arriving</p>
<p>Some days I walk the 2.4 miles across the bridge,
along the freeway,
past the man in a Mad Hatter outfit
spinning a sign selling <span class="caps"><span class="caps">BBQ</span></span> Ribs,
past 3 bus stops where a woman is stuffing her purse with blank slips of paper,
just to buy a large coffee from&nbsp;the&nbsp;7-11.</p>

Somewhere among the clouds above;

<p>As I speak
highly civilized human beings are flying overhead,
trying to kill me.
They do not feel any enmity against me
as an individual,
nor I&nbsp;against&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Most of them,
I have no doubt&nbsp;are&nbsp;kind-hearted.</p>
<p>Law-abiding men
who would never dream of committing murder
in private life.
But
if one of them succeeds
he will never sleep any the worse for it.
He is serving his country.
He will be absolved&nbsp;from&nbsp;evil.</p>
<p><em>and hangs herself&nbsp;while&nbsp;saying:</em></p>

A waste of breath the years behind
