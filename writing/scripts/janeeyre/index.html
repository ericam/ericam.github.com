<p><em>[Charlotte/Bell appears in silence.
She turns on some lights and fiddles in the space.
The band takes their places, checking mics.
Bell places a circular rug and chair on the floor
in the center of the playing space,
and turns on the overhead projector.
Transparency:&nbsp;“<span class="caps"><span class="caps">JANE</span></span>/<span class="caps"><span class="caps">EYRE</span></span>…”]</em></p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
Hi, welcome. We’ll start in a minute.
I’m Charlotte, the author of Jane Eyre, An Autobiography.
Not my autobiography, but I had to write it, since Jane is fictional.
Ah, here’s Jane, she’s in the band <em>[Narrator waves]</em>.
And our other Jane in the back.
Two Janes. You’ll get used to it,&nbsp;I&nbsp;have.</p>
<p><em>[Jane arrives, somewhat unanimated,
carrying the remainder of&nbsp;her&nbsp;outfit.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
You know, I wrote to Robert Southey once,
for advice on becoming a writer.
He firmly&nbsp;responded&nbsp;that…</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
“literature cannot be the business of a woman’s life,
and it ought not to be.
The more she is engaged in her proper duties,
the less leisure she will have&nbsp;for&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
“Her&nbsp;proper&nbsp;duties”?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I don’t know, babies&nbsp;or&nbsp;something?</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
If it “cannot” and “ought not”,
it seems like a worthy endeavor to me!
In any case, I have a vague impression that authoresses
are liable to be looked on with prejudice.
So: I intend to proceed as the more androgynous&nbsp;Currer&nbsp;Bell.</p>
<p>Currer, of course, after Frances Mary Richardson Currer &#8212;
famed book collector and scholar;
and Bell from Arthur Bell Nicholls, who I later married.
Oh yes, I married. Bad feminist? Anyway, shall&nbsp;we&nbsp;begin?</p>
<p>I present, Jane Eyre: An Autobiography by Currer Bell,
illustrated by <span class="caps"><span class="caps">F. H.</span></span> Townsend (also me) &#8212;
Service and Paton, 5 Henrietta Street, London. 1847.
And the stage adaptation:
Songs and Stories of Jane Eyre, with Teacup Gorilla,
right now, 2132 Market Street, Denver, 2018.
Can we have lights and music? This is your cue, Janes.
Yes both Janes, and you&#8212;
Mrs Reed for&nbsp;now&nbsp;please.</p>
<p><em>[Music:&nbsp;Gateshead&nbsp;theme…]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day;
and I was glad of it.
Dreadful to me the cold winter wind, and nipped fingers.
My aunt, Mary Reed, lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside,
with her darlings about her.
Me, she had dispensed from joining&nbsp;the&nbsp;group.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[to Mrs. Reed]</em> What am I said to&nbsp;have&nbsp;done?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Reed:</strong>
Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners.
Be seated somewhere, and&nbsp;remain&nbsp;silent!</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
<em>[interrupting]</em> Sorry, a moment, please.
A preface to the first edition of “Jane Eyre” being unnecessary,
I gave none: this second edition demands a few words of&nbsp;miscellaneous&nbsp;remark.</p>
<p>To the timorous or carping few
who doubt the tendency of such books as “Jane Eyre:”
in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong
and whose ears detect in each protest against bigotry an insult to piety:
I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions:
Conventionality is not morality.
Self-righteousness is not religion.
To attack the first is not to assail the last.
This work is respectfully inscribed by the author,&nbsp;Currer&nbsp;Bell.</p>
<p>Excuse&nbsp;me.&nbsp;Music?</p>

A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room.
I slipped in there, and soon possessed myself of a volume,
taking care that it should be one with pictures:
Bewick’s History of British Birds.
I mounted into the window-seat:
gathering up my feet,
and drawing the red moreen curtain&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;close.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs Reed:</strong>
You have no business to take our books;
you have no money; your father left you none;
you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen’s children.
Now, I’ll&nbsp;teach&nbsp;you!</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
You are like a murderer&#8212;
you are like a slave-driver&#8212;

I had read Goldsmith’s History of Rome,

<p><em>[Jane is taken away. She resists, resolved&nbsp;in&nbsp;desperation.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
Yes, ok, we’ve had to simplify and rearrange some things.
No John Reed, no Adele, or Mrs. Fairfax,
or any of the servants and bit parts that work so well in a novel.
We don’t have budget for all that, and you don’t have time.
In fact, we’re already in the middle of&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;2.</p>

November, December, and half of January&nbsp;passed&nbsp;away.</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play.
We’re in chapter&nbsp;4&nbsp;already!</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
For nearly three months, I had never been called to Mrs. Reed’s presence.
I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted.
From this vantage, I saw the gates&nbsp;thrown&nbsp;open&#8212;</p>
<p><em>[Transparency: Mr Brocklehurst shadow.

Jane&nbsp;Eyre,&nbsp;sir.</p>
<p><strong>*Brocklehurst:</strong>
Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a&nbsp;good&nbsp;child?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Reed:</strong>
Perhaps the less said on that subject the better,&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Brocklehurst.</p>
<p><strong>*Brocklehurst:</strong>
Do you know where the wicked go&nbsp;after&nbsp;death?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
They go&nbsp;to&nbsp;hell.</p>
<p><strong>*Brocklehurst:</strong>
And what must you do to avoid&nbsp;that&nbsp;pit?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I must keep in good health, and&nbsp;not&nbsp;die.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Not the answer he was looking for, perhaps. But I&nbsp;like&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Reed:</strong>
Jane, sit down! Mr. Brocklehurst,
this little girl has not quite the character and disposition I could wish.
Should you admit her into Lowood School,
I should be glad if the teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her,
and to guard against her worst fault, a tendency&nbsp;to&nbsp;deceit.</p>
<p><strong>*Brocklehurst:</strong>
All liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire&nbsp;and&nbsp;brimstone.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I saw myself transformed under the stranger’s eye
into an artful,&nbsp;noxious&nbsp;child.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Reed:</strong>
I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects:
to be made useful, and kept humble.
As for the vacations, she will, with your permission,
spend them always&nbsp;at&nbsp;Lowood.</p>
<p><strong>*Brocklehurst:</strong>
Your decisions are perfectly&nbsp;judicious,&nbsp;madam.</p>
<p><em>[Transparency: “Gateshead Hall: Shame is&nbsp;Passed&nbsp;On…”]</em></p>

Go out of the room; return to&nbsp;the&nbsp;nursery.</p>
<p><em>[Jane turns to go, but&nbsp;turns&nbsp;back.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I am not deceitful! if I were, I should say I loved you;
but I declare I do not love you:
I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world.
I will never call you aunt again as long as I live.
I will never come to see you when I am grown up;
and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me,
I will say the very thought of you makes me sick.
People think you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted.
You&nbsp;are&nbsp;deceitful!</p>

Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be&nbsp;a&nbsp;liar?</p>
<p><strong>Helen:</strong>
Everybody, Jane? Why,
there are only eighty people who have heard you called so,
and the world contains hundreds&nbsp;of&nbsp;millions.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
But what have I to do with millions? The eighty, I know,&nbsp;despise&nbsp;me.</p>
<p><strong>Helen:</strong>
Jane, you are mistaken:

many, I am sure, pity&nbsp;you&nbsp;much.</p>

How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst&nbsp;has&nbsp;said?</p>

I should resist him. If he struck me with that rod,
I should get it from his hand;

<p><strong>Jane:</strong>

Spring drew on: flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.
April advanced to May: days of blue sky, placid sunshine,

these fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood,

Vanity Fair, by my favorite author, William Thackeray &#8212;

than his contemporaries have yet recognized.

Therefore, I now pass a space of eight years almost in silence.
During these eight years my life was uniform.

I desired liberty; but it seemed a dream, swept off into vague space.

<p><em>[Music:&nbsp;Thornfield&nbsp;theme…]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
The roads were heavy, the night misty.
My carriage slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house.
It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though considerable:
a&nbsp;gentleman’s&nbsp;manor-house.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Mrs. Fairfax,&nbsp;I&nbsp;suppose?</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
There’s a brief comedy of errors and mistaken identities,
where Jane assumes that Mrs Fairfax is the mistress of&nbsp;this&nbsp;mansion.</p>
<p><em>[to audience]</em> Mistress is a funny word, actually.
In this case I mean “a woman who has power, authority, or ownership:
such as the female head of a household” &#8212;
but as with most words for women,
it will later come to mean the near opposite:
“a woman who is courted or kept by a married man” &#8212;
soon-to-be an apt description of Jane, though she doesn’t know it.
Spoiler alert.
Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper, and mostly slows down the action,
so we’ve cut her from this version.
But I’ll take a few of her lines &#8212;
just to give you&nbsp;a&nbsp;taste.</p>

<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
October, November, December passed away.
I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole’s laugh.
Sometimes I saw her: she would come out of her room with a plate in her hand,
go down to the kitchen and shortly return, bearing a pot of porter.
Hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest&nbsp;could&nbsp;attach.</p>
<p>My pupil, Adèle Varens had been spoilt and indulged,
but she soon became obedient and teachable.
She had no great talents which raised her one inch
above the ordinary level of childhood;
but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her&nbsp;below&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
That’s what my teachers said about me, at Cowan Bridge.
“Charlotte Brontë: Reads tolerably &#8212;

Reader: This, par parenthèse, will be thought cool language
by persons who entertain solemn doctrines
about the angelic nature of children:
but I am not here to flatter parental egotism, or prop up humbug;
I am merely telling&nbsp;the&nbsp;truth.</p>
<p>Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further,
that I desire more of practical experience than I possess.
I value what is good in Mrs. Fairfax and in Adèle;
but I believe in the existence of other, and more vivid kinds&nbsp;of&nbsp;goodness.</p>
<p>I shall be called discontented, no doubt.
Women are supposed to be very calm generally:
but women feel just as men feel;
they need exercise for their faculties,
and a field for their efforts.
They suffer from too rigid a restraint, precisely as men would suffer.
It is narrow-minded to say that women ought to confine themselves
to making puddings and knitting stockings,
to playing on the piano and&nbsp;embroidering&nbsp;bags.</p>

What can she do? Just be still. There! I am up now.
Did you see anything when you opened your&nbsp;chamber&nbsp;door?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
No, sir, only the candlestick on&nbsp;the&nbsp;ground.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
But you heard the&nbsp;odd&nbsp;laugh?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole, &#8212;
she laughs in&nbsp;that&nbsp;way.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Just so. Grace Poole&#8212;you have&nbsp;guessed&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Band Voices:</strong>

- What a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!
- It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at night.

- Mrs. Poole, the servants’ dinner will soon be ready: will you come down?
- No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on&nbsp;a&nbsp;tray,</p>

<p><em>[Music: Jane’s theme. Transparency: “Thornfield Hall:&nbsp;Fire&nbsp;Away…”]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
The morning passed just as usual,
but I puzzled over the character of Grace Poole,
and why she had not been given into custody that morning.
Mr. Rochester had declared his conviction of her criminality just&nbsp;last&nbsp;night.</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
That thought is interrupted when we find that
Mr. Rochester is gone to the Leas without a goodbye &#8212;
ten miles, the other side of Millcote &#8212;
where he is likely to stay a week or more.
“The ladies” there are fond&nbsp;of&nbsp;him.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
There are ladies at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Leas?</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
Very elegant young ladies indeed; Blanche and Mary Ingram.
Blanche came to a Christmas ball,
and she was considered the belle of&nbsp;the&nbsp;evening.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
What was&nbsp;she&nbsp;like?</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck:
olive complexion, dark and clear; noble features.
And then she had such a fine head of hair, the glossiest curls I&nbsp;ever&nbsp;saw.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
She was&nbsp;greatly&nbsp;admired?</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
Yes, Yes: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
She and Mr. Rochester sang&nbsp;a&nbsp;duet.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
A greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath&nbsp;of&nbsp;life.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[in a mirror]</em> You, a favourite with Mr. Rochester,
and gifted with the power of pleasing him? Poor&nbsp;stupid&nbsp;dupe!</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence.
Place the glass before you, and draw in chalk your own picture,
faithfully, without softening one defect. Write under it,
‘Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor,&nbsp;and&nbsp;plain.’</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?&nbsp;Blind&nbsp;puppy!</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Afterwards, choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils;
delineate carefully the loveliest face you can imagine;
paint it in your softest shades and sweetest lines.
Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments,
the Grecian neck and bust, and the delicate hand.
Call it ‘Blanche, an accomplished lady&nbsp;of&nbsp;rank.’</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Is it likely Mr. Rochester would waste a serious thought
on this indigent and&nbsp;insignificant&nbsp;plebeian?</p>

It had been a mild, serene spring day,
when at last four equestrians galloped up the drive.
The third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse;
at his side rode&nbsp;Miss&nbsp;Ingram.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Look how she leans her head towards him
as if she were&nbsp;conversing&nbsp;confidentially.</p>

<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Coffee was handed, and there was life everywhere; movement all day long.
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall.
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself at the piano,
commenced a brilliant prelude; talking meantime.
“Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!” exclaimed she.
“Poor, puny things, not fit to go outside without&nbsp;mama’s&nbsp;permission!”</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
She’s a real bore, if you ask me &#8212;
but constantly flirting with Mr Rochester.
The party seems to last for days.
Jane is instructed to join, but never allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;participate.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Not that I wanted to.
They spoke of “playing charades,” but I did not understand&nbsp;the&nbsp;term.</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
Here, we’ll show you the best bit.
Imagine, for a minute, that I’m the beautiful&nbsp;Miss&nbsp;Ingram.</p>
<p>_Bell and Rochester act out a marriage, with lots of flirting.

<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I saw he was going to marry her &#8212;
for family, perhaps political reasons &#8212;
but I was not jealous. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy:
very showy, but not genuine. She had a fine person, but her heart was barren.
She did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness&nbsp;and&nbsp;truth.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[to the camera]</em> I have told you, reader,
that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester:
I could not unlove him now,
merely because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady,
who scorned to touch me with the hem of&nbsp;her&nbsp;robes.</p>

I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason;
that he was but just arrived in England,
and that he came from some hot country.
Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, and Spanish Town,

Mr. Mason makes himself at home, as another stranger arrives &#8212;
an “old woman, quite troublesome” &#8212;

I hope to save money enough out of my earnings to set up a school,

A true Janian reply! She comes from the other world &#8212;
If I dared, I’d touch you, to see if you are substance or shadow, you elf!
Come. You must see the carriage, Jane,
and tell me if you don’t think it will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly;
and whether she won’t look like Queen Boadicea.
I wish, Jane, I were a trifle better match with her externally.

<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
Let’s skip ahead to the wedding day. Or the night before? I’m&nbsp;not&nbsp;sure.</p>
<p><em>[Music:&nbsp;Thornfield&nbsp;theme…]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Descending the laurel walk,
I faced the wreck of the chestnut-tree under which he had proposed;
it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the centre.
As yet, however, they might be said to form one tree &#8212;
a ruin, but an&nbsp;entire&nbsp;ruin.</p>
<p>Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy.
Mrs Fairfax called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress,
which they had just brought; and under it in the box I found a present &#8212;
the veil which, in his princely extravagance,
Mr Rochester had sent from London.
I smiled as I unfolded it,
and devised how I would tease him about his&nbsp;aristocratic&nbsp;tastes.</p>
<p>As it grew dark, the wind rose with a sullen, moaning sound.
For some time after I went to bed, I could&nbsp;not&nbsp;sleep…</p>
<p><em>[The projector is turned off.
Bertha appears with haunting screeches,
tries on the veil, and rips it&nbsp;to&nbsp;pieces…]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
This was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not even that strange woman,&nbsp;Grace&nbsp;Poole.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
It must have been one&nbsp;of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
No, sir. The shape reminded me of the foul German spectre &#8212;&nbsp;the&nbsp;Vampyre.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
My treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough handling.
Once united, there shall be no recurrence of these&nbsp;mental&nbsp;terrors.</p>
<p><em>[Transparency: “Thornfield Hall:&nbsp;Once&nbsp;United…”]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Mental&nbsp;terrors,&nbsp;sir!</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
If it’s not nerves it’s hysteria, if it’s not hysteria it’s the vapors,
if it’s not the vapors then it’s bicycle face… Seriously, look&nbsp;it&nbsp;up.</p>

<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
Now, it is certainly the wedding day.
We’ll skip all the bits about preparation,
and Rochester rushing Jane to the church in a&nbsp;seeming&nbsp;panic.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Lingerer! My brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry&nbsp;so&nbsp;long!</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
If either of you know any impediment
why ye may not lawfully be joined together in matrimony,
ye do now&nbsp;confess&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><em>[Transparency: Mr&nbsp;Mason&nbsp;shadow…]</em></p>
<p><strong>*Mason:</strong>
The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.
Mr. Rochester has a wife now living at Thornfield Hall.
I saw her there last April, and I am&nbsp;her&nbsp;brother.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
At Thornfield Hall! Impossible!
I never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at&nbsp;Thornfield&nbsp;Hall.</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
<em>[running to become Bertha]</em> Oh shit, that’s&nbsp;my&nbsp;cue!</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
No, by God! I took care that none should hear of it &#8212;

I am little better than a devil at this moment.
Gentlemen, my plan is broken up. Come all of you&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;follow!</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id29">*Bertha&nbsp;Revealed</a></h3>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
You know this place, Mason. She bit and stabbed&nbsp;you&nbsp;here.</p>
<p><em>[The &quot;clothed hyena&quot; rises up, and stands tall on its hind-feet,
with&nbsp;haunting&nbsp;screeches.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
That is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago, &#8212;
Bertha Mason by name. She came of a mad family;
idiots and maniacs through&nbsp;three&nbsp;generations!</p>
<p><strong>Bertha:</strong>
<em>[to camera]</em> I don’t even know where to start.
You should read the ways Bertha is described in this book.
Here’s Jane, in a bit we&nbsp;cut&nbsp;earlier…</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
It was a discoloured face &#8212;
it was a savage face. The lips were swelled and dark;
the brow furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the&nbsp;bloodshot&nbsp;eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Bertha:</strong>
In this scene I’m described as a beast, a clothed hyena &#8212;
from Jamaica. We really didn’t know how to deal with that,
but we can’t ignore Brontë’s colonial…
how do you say “white supremacy” in&nbsp;Victorian&nbsp;English?</p>
<p>So, what am I doing here? Am I an expression of Brontë’s more wild aspects &#8212;
restrained by custom and society?
I&#8217;m not sure, but here I am:
the angry woman, the crazy ex-girlfriend,
or just someone held in the attic for 10 years against my will.
What would you do? Would you rage?
Would you bite back, and resist to the fiery end?
I plan to. This isn’t&nbsp;over&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Go to&nbsp;the&nbsp;devil!</p>
<p><em>[Mr. Rochester and Bertha fight, with more haunting screeches &#8212;
and she is subdued. Music:&nbsp;Thornfield&nbsp;theme…]</em></p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Such is the sole embrace I am ever to know!
And this is what I wished to have.
This young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth of hell,
looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon.
Look at the difference; then&nbsp;judge&nbsp;me!</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
The priest clears Jane from all blame,
then disappears into the night with Mr Mason &#8212;
leaving our&nbsp;lovebirds&nbsp;alone.</p>
<p><em>[Transparency: “Thornfield Hall:&nbsp;Once&nbsp;United…”]</em></p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
All is prepared for prompt departure:
tomorrow we shall go, and be free of these terrors forever!
I have a place to repair to, which will be&nbsp;our&nbsp;sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[to camera]</em> If I could go out of life now, dear reader,
without too sharp a pang, it would be well for me.
I must leave him, it appears. I do not want to leave him &#8212;
I cannot leave him.
<em>[to Rochester]</em> Mr. Rochester, I must&nbsp;leave&nbsp;you.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?
My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?
Oh, Jane! my hope &#8212;
my love &#8212;
my life! You don’t love me, then?
It was only my station, and the rank of my wife, that&nbsp;you&nbsp;valued?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
These words cut me: yet what could I do or&nbsp;I&nbsp;say?</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Will you hear reason, Jane?
<em>[too close]</em> Because, if you won’t, I’ll try violence.
<em>[backing off]</em> But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well.
After a youth passed in misery and solitude,
I have for the first time found what I can truly love &#8212;
I have found you. You are my sympathy &#8212;
my better self &#8212;
my good angel. I think you good, gifted, lovely: I am bound to you.
I was wrong to deceive you; I&nbsp;was&nbsp;cowardly.</p>
<p><em>[He makes an effort to rest his head on her shoulder,
but she won’t&nbsp;permit&nbsp;it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
You see now how the case stands &#8212;
do you not? To say that I already have a wife is empty mockery:
you know now that I have but a&nbsp;hideous&nbsp;demon.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Sir, you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
you speak of her with hate &#8212;
with vindictive antipathy. It is cruel &#8212;
she cannot help&nbsp;being&nbsp;mad.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Jane, my little darling, you don’t know what you are talking about:
it is not because she is mad I hate her.
If you were mad, do you think I should&nbsp;hate&nbsp;you?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I do&nbsp;indeed,&nbsp;sir.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id30">Wandering The&nbsp;Wilderness,&nbsp;Destitute</a></h3>
<p><em>[Music:&nbsp;Wandering…]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I knew what I had to do, and I did it mechanically.
The great gates were closed and locked;
but a wicket in one of them was only latched.
Through that I departed; and now I was out&nbsp;of&nbsp;Thornfield.</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
Sorry, we’re off-track, and I’m not sure where we’re heading&nbsp;now.&nbsp;Jane?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[handing Bell a transparency]</em> This is&nbsp;your&nbsp;fault.</p>
<p><em>[Transparency: “The Wilderness:&nbsp;Wandering,&nbsp;Destitute…”]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[directly to the audience]</em> Two days are passed, already.
It is a summer evening;
the coachman has set me down at a place called Whitcross.
I am not possessed of another shilling in&nbsp;the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I looked at the sky; it was pure:
a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge.
Nature seemed to me benign and good; she loved me, outcast as I was.
From man I could anticipate only mistrust, rejection,&nbsp;and&nbsp;insult.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Not a tie holds me to human society at&nbsp;this&nbsp;moment.</p>
<p><em>[Transparency: A woman in shadow,&nbsp;a&nbsp;shopkeeper…]</em></p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Do you know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant&nbsp;is&nbsp;wanted?</p>
<p><strong>*Woman:</strong>
Nay; I&nbsp;couldn’t&nbsp;say.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
What is the chief trade in this place? What do most of the&nbsp;people&nbsp;do?</p>
<p><strong>*Woman:</strong>
Some are farm labourers; a good deal work at Mr.
Oliver’s needle-factory, and at&nbsp;the&nbsp;foundry.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Does Mr. Oliver&nbsp;employ&nbsp;women?</p>
<p><strong>*Woman:</strong>
Nay; it was&nbsp;men’s&nbsp;work.</p>
<p><em>[Transparency: “The Wilderness:&nbsp;Wandering,&nbsp;Destitute…”]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I drew near houses;
I left them, and came back again, and again I wandered away:
always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask &#8212;
no right to expect interest in my&nbsp;isolated&nbsp;lot.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[to audience]</em> Reader, I blame none of those who repulse me.
An ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion;
a well-dressed beggar&nbsp;inevitably&nbsp;so.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood.
The ground was damp, the air cold.
Towards morning it rained; the whole of the following day&nbsp;was&nbsp;wet.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[to audience]</em> Do not ask me, reader, to give a minute account of this day;
as before, I sought work; as before, I was repulsed; as before,&nbsp;I&nbsp;starved.</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
We’ve cut it short, but Jane lives like this for nearly a week &#8212;
eating only discarded scraps, sleeping under trees, braving terrible weather.
Pretty gutsy, I’d say, even by&nbsp;today’s&nbsp;standards&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I did what had to be done. Now I can&nbsp;but&nbsp;die.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
I lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me,
and died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast,
wetting me afresh to the skin. Could I have stiffened to the still frost &#8212;
the friendly numbness of death &#8212;
it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
but my living&nbsp;flesh&nbsp;shuddered.</p>

<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I can never&nbsp;reach&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><em>[The house is moved closer to Jane. Music:&nbsp;Diana&#8217;s&nbsp;theme…]</em></p>

Wonderful! <em>[to additional actress]</em> We’ll have you play a new man,
more ethical than Mr Rochester.
The local parson, named “Saint John River” who can nurse you back&nbsp;to&nbsp;health.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[to Bell]</em> They pronounce it “Sinjun” when used as a given name.
Anyway, he’s a Calvinist &#8212;

<em>[to additional actress]</em> You should play his sister, Diana, instead!

Fine. I’ll play St John, so we don’t lose&nbsp;him&nbsp;entirely.</p>
<p><strong>*John:</strong>
Young woman, rise, and pass before me into&nbsp;the&nbsp;house.</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
<em>[stepping out of character]</em> How&nbsp;was&nbsp;that?</p>
<p><em>[Transparency: “Moor House: Family <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Independence…”]</em></p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong>
Poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer &#8212;
What’s&nbsp;your&nbsp;name?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
My name is&nbsp;Jane&nbsp;Elliott.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Anxious to avoid discovery, I had resolved to assume&nbsp;an&nbsp;alias.</p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong>
You have a peculiar face; I rather&nbsp;like&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Never once did I hear from Diana one syllable of regret or suspicion.
Meantime a month&nbsp;was&nbsp;gone.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[to audience]</em> The more I know Diana, dear reader,  the better I like her.
I can join in all her occupations,
and converse with her as much as she wishes.
There is a reviving pleasure in this intercourse,
of a kind now tasted by me for the&nbsp;first&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy did not extend to him.
He seemed a reserved and&nbsp;brooding&nbsp;creature.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his life and habits,
he does not appear to&nbsp;enjoy…&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
But he does find you&nbsp;a&nbsp;job.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>&nbsp;Explain.</p>
<p><strong>*John:</strong>
This town, when I came to it, had no school:
the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of progress.
I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school for girls.
Your salary will be thirty pounds&nbsp;a&nbsp;year.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all&nbsp;my&nbsp;heart.</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
<em>[stepping out of character]</em>
Ok, I gave the Moor House equal time in the book,
but we can’t do that here, so I’ll fill you in.
First, a letter arrives,
telling St John and Diana that their long-forgotten uncle has died.
He had a large fortune, but has left it to someone else.&nbsp;Oh&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>They all shrug, and go on with life.
There are side-plots regarding the school,
and a likely love interest for St John: Miss Rosamond Oliver.
Jane is shipping them hard, and paints Miss Oliver’s portrait for St John,
who pines over it in Calvinist agony &#8212;
then rips a corner of the page,
and runs off into the night.
Using the stolen signature, he discovers Jane’s real name,&nbsp;and&nbsp;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Let Diana deliver&nbsp;the&nbsp;news:</p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong>
Your name is Jane Eyre, is&nbsp;it&nbsp;not?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>&nbsp;It&nbsp;is.</p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong>
You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake, Diana Eyre Rivers?
My mother was your father’s sister.
My uncle who died, was your uncle John of Madeira.
What he did not leave to us, he has left to you: all his property.
You are&nbsp;now&nbsp;rich.</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
At such time as I was writing,
there was no such thing as the “rich uncle” trope &#8212;
now so popular.
Perhaps I created it?
Nonetheless, I can acknowledge that is rather surprising and, well,
convenient for&nbsp;Jane’s&nbsp;situation.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
You, then, are&nbsp;my&nbsp;cousins?</p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong>
We are&nbsp;cousins;&nbsp;yes.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Oh, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;glad!</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
That’s the part you are&nbsp;glad&nbsp;about?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I had nobody; and now&nbsp;two&nbsp;relations!</p>
<p><strong>Bell:</strong>
And&nbsp;the&nbsp;money?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Fifteen thousand pounds, divided equally between the three of us,
will give five thousand&nbsp;to&nbsp;each.</p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong>
But, Jane, what if&nbsp;you&nbsp;marry?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Nonsense! I don’t want to marry, and never shall marry.
I like Moor House, and I will attach myself for life&nbsp;to&nbsp;Diana.</p>

As our mutual happiness settled into a quieter character,
Diana and I resumed our usual habits and regular studies.
Diana had offered to teach me German, and I liked to learn from her.
Our natures dovetailed into mutual affection of the strongest kind.
St. John sat with us often, pondering some&nbsp;Eastern&nbsp;tongue.</p>

<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
You are not&nbsp;in&nbsp;earnest?</p>

I am the servant of an infallible Master. My king is the All-perfect.
Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer.
I claim you &#8212;
not for my pleasure, but for my&nbsp;Sovereign’s&nbsp;service.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;Yuck.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[to audience]</em> Reader, I can do what he wants me to do &#8212;
and yet I shudder. He prizes me as a soldier would a good weapon;
and that is all.
Can I receive from him the bridal ring,
endure all the forms of love
(which I doubt not he would scrupulously observe)
and know that the spirit was quite absent? No.
<em>[to John]</em> I am ready to go to India, if I may go free &#8212;
as your cousin, not&nbsp;your&nbsp;wife.</p>
<p><strong>*John:</strong>
Do you think God will be satisfied with half&nbsp;a&nbsp;sacrifice?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Oh! I will give my heart to God. You do not&nbsp;want&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>*John:</strong>
Though you have a man’s vigorous brain, you have a woman’s heart.
I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life,
and retain absolutely till death. Undoubtedly enough of love&nbsp;would&nbsp;follow.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I scorn your idea of love: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you&nbsp;offer&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>*John:</strong>
Refuse to be my wife,
and you limit yourself for ever
to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity.
Why&nbsp;this&nbsp;refusal?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Formerly, because you did not love me. Now, because you almost&nbsp;hate&nbsp;me.</p>
<p><strong>*John:</strong>
You shall be numbered with those who have denied the faith,
and are worse&nbsp;than&nbsp;infidels!</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id36">Flipped&nbsp;Proposal</a></h3>
<p><em>[Music:&nbsp;Thornfield&nbsp;theme…]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
In his countenance I saw a change: desperate and brooding &#8212;
reminding me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird,
dangerous to approach in his sullen woe.
He opened his eyelids; gazed blank.
One saw that all to him was void darkness.
His left arm, mutilated, he kept hidden in&nbsp;his&nbsp;bosom.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[to audience]</em> And, reader,
do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity? &#8212;
if you do, you little know me.
<em>[to Rochester]</em> Will you take my&nbsp;arm,&nbsp;sir?</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Let&nbsp;me&nbsp;alone.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Do you know&nbsp;me,&nbsp;sir?</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Wait! Who is this? Speak again! Great God! &#8212;
what delusion has come&nbsp;over&nbsp;me?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Your mind, sir, is too strong&nbsp;for&nbsp;delusion.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Her very fingers! Her small, slight fingers! Is it Jane? This is her shape &#8212;
this is her size &#8212;
there must be more&nbsp;of&nbsp;her!</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
And this her voice. She is all here: her&nbsp;heart,&nbsp;too.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
In truth? &#8212;
in the flesh? My living Jane?
You do not lie dead in some ditch under&nbsp;some&nbsp;stream?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
No, sir! I am an independent&nbsp;woman&nbsp;now.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
What, Janet! You are an&nbsp;independent&nbsp;woman?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I can build a house of my own close up to your door,
and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want company of&nbsp;an&nbsp;evening.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
But you are rich, Jane.
No doubt you have friends who will not allow you
to devote yourself to a blind monster&nbsp;like&nbsp;me?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
He&nbsp;hasn’t&nbsp;changed.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I told you I am independent, sir. I am my own mistress.
I will be your neighbour, your nurse, your housekeeper.
I will be your companion &#8212;
to read to you, to walk with you, to sit with you,
to wait on you, to be eyes and hands&nbsp;to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young &#8212;
you must marry&nbsp;one&nbsp;day.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I don’t care about being married. Have you a pocket-comb about&nbsp;you,&nbsp;sir?</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Am I&nbsp;hideous,&nbsp;Jane?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Very, sir: you&nbsp;always&nbsp;were.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Humph! The wickedness has not been taken out of you,
wherever you&nbsp;have&nbsp;traveled.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Yet I have been with good people; far better&nbsp;than&nbsp;you.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;Far&nbsp;better.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Were there only ladies in the house where you&nbsp;have&nbsp;been?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
<em>[to Narrator]</em> Go with it.
<em>[to Rochester]</em> There was a very good man, sir; St.&nbsp;John&nbsp;Rivers.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
This&nbsp;is&nbsp;gross.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Is he an able&nbsp;man,&nbsp;then?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>&nbsp;Truly&nbsp;able.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
A thoroughly&nbsp;educated&nbsp;man?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar. He is a&nbsp;handsome&nbsp;man.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Damn him! Did you like&nbsp;him,&nbsp;Jane?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Yes, Mr. Rochester, I&nbsp;liked&nbsp;him.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Did he ever come there to&nbsp;see&nbsp;you?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Now&nbsp;and&nbsp;then?</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Of&nbsp;an&nbsp;evening?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Once&nbsp;or&nbsp;twice.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
He wanted you to&nbsp;marry&nbsp;him?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
He asked me to&nbsp;marry&nbsp;him.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
He threatened us. They&nbsp;both&nbsp;did.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Jane, I am not a fool &#8212;&nbsp;go&nbsp;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Where must I&nbsp;go,&nbsp;sir?</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Your own way &#8212;
with the husband you&nbsp;have&nbsp;chosen.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;Husband?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Who&nbsp;is&nbsp;that?</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
You know &#8212;
this St.&nbsp;John&nbsp;Rivers.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Even his jealousy&nbsp;is&nbsp;disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
St. John is not my husband, nor ever will be.
He does not love me: I do not&nbsp;love&nbsp;him.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
What, Jane! Is&nbsp;this&nbsp;true?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
All my heart is&nbsp;yours,&nbsp;sir.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Not all. Why are&nbsp;we&nbsp;here?</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Because you delight&nbsp;in&nbsp;sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
He agrees&nbsp;with&nbsp;me.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Sacrifice! What do&nbsp;I&nbsp;sacrifice?</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
To bear with a crippled man, twenty years older than you &#8212;
to overlook&nbsp;my&nbsp;deficiencies.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
Not the deficiencies you&nbsp;think,&nbsp;sir.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
I love you better now than I did in your state of proud independence,
when you disdained every part but that of the giver&nbsp;and&nbsp;protector.</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
You speak as a friend, Jane; but I want&nbsp;a&nbsp;wife.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
Do&nbsp;you,&nbsp;sir?</p>
<p><strong>Rochester:</strong>
Will you marry&nbsp;me,&nbsp;Jane?</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
It is nearly four o’clock in the afternoon, sir. Don’t you&nbsp;feel&nbsp;hungry?</p>

<p><em>[Jane returns.
Jane and Narrator stand looking at each other in silence,
then turn off&nbsp;their&nbsp;mics.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>
That’s not how it ends in&nbsp;the&nbsp;book.</p>
<p><strong>Jane:</strong>
It’s the best I&nbsp;can&nbsp;do.</p>
