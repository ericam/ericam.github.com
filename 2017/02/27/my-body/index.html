      <p>I wasn&#8217;t born in the wrong body.
I was born in <em>my</em> body.
Without it, I don&#8217;t&nbsp;exist.</p>
<p><em>I was born, a&nbsp;body.</em></p>
<p>Some bodies have freckles,
while some are six-foot-four and near-sighted.
Some grow thick hair,
while others have autism.
Each body comes with a unique mix of experiences —
affordances and constraints.
This body isn&#8217;t wrong,
it&#8217;s&nbsp;trans.</p>
<p>My genitals don&#8217;t match my gender,
the way some bodies&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>You might need help with insulin.
I need help with estrogen.
I don&#8217;t mean to medicalize this experience —
only to claim it,
and put it in my body.
I operate better on hormones I don&#8217;t produce.
Most women call that menopause.
I call it&nbsp;transition.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There&#8217;s a temptation to cherry-pick the past,
to emphasize one particular story-arc,
associate myself with the proper stereotypes,
and prove I was <em>born this way</em> —
a girl from my first&nbsp;breath.</p>
<p>In the final years before my transition,
I was begging the pieces to fit perfectly.
I wanted a narrative that could prove my gender,
once and for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t&nbsp;one.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A friend asks me what it means to be a woman.
I have no idea.
What does it mean for you to be your&nbsp;gender?</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I&#8217;m terrified that I just want sleepovers,
and I&#8217;m too late for&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>The internet is all tweens and teens,
afraid they are too old for hormones.
I read all the wrong things,
and cry for&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I believed gender was only a performance
when my own gender was a performance.
Others believe gender aligns with genitals,
because theirs does.
It&#8217;s hard to look beyond your own experience.
That&#8217;s why we have&nbsp;empathy.</p>
<p>I realized I was trans
when rejecting gender only made things&nbsp;worse.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Your humanity is not a debate.
Your value is not a difference of opinion.&nbsp;❤</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I never felt like a girl.
What do girls feel like?
I didn&#8217;t <em>always know</em>,
and dream of wearing dresses.
I wasn&#8217;t consistent, insistent, or&nbsp;persistent.</p>
<p>I was <em>frustrated</em>.</p>
<p>Even after I pinned that pain
on my gender,
it took years to make sense of the&nbsp;pieces.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t know the pain is real
until it goes&nbsp;away.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Transition is a wild waffling
between dysphoria and euphoria.
The changes are minor,
and the effect is unbelievable.
I&#8217;m the same person,
and not at all the same person.
I lost two show&nbsp;sizes.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>When they gender you right,
in that condecending tone reserved for women.
Stealth is a mixed&nbsp;blessing.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Many people become frustrated by the trappings of gender —
the rules and regulations imposed by our culture.
Then the boys find their inner princess,
and girls grow up to be president (please),
and everyone moves&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>As my brother says,
<em>cis does not mean&nbsp;simple</em>.</p>
<p>I wanted that story too —
a complex gender,
breaking from tradition
without crossing any lines.
I hoped gender was only a construct,
and a change in performance could destroy my dysphoria.
I wanted to express my feminine traits and move&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>But <em>feminine</em> is not my gender.
Painted nails are not what it means to be a woman.
Gender is often performed,
but the performance is not the whole story.
The play is not the&nbsp;thing.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A visiting trans friend asks where I get my&nbsp;T.</p>
<p><em>I make it inside my body</em>,
I tell him.
<em>I&#8217;d give it to you if I&nbsp;could</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>My doctor doesn&#8217;t require
a therapist&#8217;s approval,
but she tells me
<em>it&#8217;s helpful if you have one</em>.
I don&#8217;t know what that means.
My therapist writes a letter,
just in&nbsp;case.</p>
<p>I have to sign a form
that explains the effects of hormone therapy.
They bring me the wrong form:
<em>Consent for Masculinizing Hormone Therapy</em>.
I ask for the other form, please.
Probably a clerical error,
but it feels&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>This is called <em>informed consent</em>.
Expect breast growth,
changes in body fat,
and thinning body hair.
Don&#8217;t expect changes in voice
or facial&nbsp;hair.</p>
<p>The form is full of typos,
but I sign it anyway.
Later that day,
I take my first hormone&nbsp;pills.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I&#8217;m still learning to identify as a woman,
and as a lesbian.
Both are over-simplifications.
Maybe a non-binary genderqueer trans
bi/pansexual femme tomboy lesbian&nbsp;woman?</p>
<p>I was assigned male,
and learned to identify as a man —
no matter how odd or painful that felt.
My identity was male for 33 years,
and that&#8217;s not easy to shake&nbsp;off.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>My gender identity is frustrated? <br />
My gender frustration is&nbsp;female?</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A friend jokes about the useless buttons
on the back of my new coat.
<em>Those buttons are&#8217;t useless</em>,
I tell him.
<em>That&#8217;s how people know I&#8217;m a&nbsp;woman</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I&#8217;m not trans because of the things I like,
or the people I sleep with.
I&#8217;m not trans in order to paint my nails,
fuck boys, join a coven,
or get a free drink on Ladies Night.
I&#8217;m not exploring my feminine side,
or enjoying the realities of sexism,
objectification, double-standards, mansplaining, and&nbsp;harassment.</p>
<p>I could do all those things before transition.
I&#8217;m trans because the doctors called me a man
and they were&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I thought I was borrowing a scraper,
but then he just cleaned off the car for me.
This doesn&#8217;t happen when you look like a boy&nbsp;person.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The bank ask to see my marriage license.
When I don&#8217;t have one,
they ask <em>the reason for your name change</em>?
I make a list of&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>That time of the&nbsp;week.</li>
<li>Just in&nbsp;case.</li>
<li>Lost my old one on the bus to&nbsp;Boulder.</li>
<li>Identity&nbsp;theft.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There&#8217;s a period where
I can&#8217;t use <em>he/him/his</em> for&nbsp;anyone.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I don&#8217;t know how many trans people I know.
After transition, many fade from view.
Cis-assumption helps us blend in,
for our own safety.
Other&#8217;s haven&#8217;t come out&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p>Visibility is dangerous,
but without it we&#8217;re monsters under the&nbsp;bed.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>When I say <em>gender change</em>,
people only hear <em>genitals</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We talk about socialization,
as though kids
only ever hear half the story —
as though we don&#8217;t train everyone
to hate women&nbsp;equally.</p>
<p>Simultaneously,
I recieved privilege as a man,
while internalizing the messages for women.
I wasn&#8217;t socialized male.
I was socialized&nbsp;binary.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Dysphoria doesn&#8217;t take the time
to stop and explain itself.
It&#8217;s a subtle,
grumpy, subconscious beast —
like an upset stomach,
or the anger you feel when you haven&#8217;t&nbsp;eaten.</p>
<p>Gender dysphoria is <em>hangry</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Cis women warn me about
the emotional terrors of estrogen.
<em>Clearly you haven&#8217;t tried testosterone</em>,
I say.
<em>That shit&#8217;ll fuck you&nbsp;up</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I tell my mom on the phone,
<em>I think I&#8217;m more binary than I think</em>.
She&#8217;s confused.
<em>I think I need to&nbsp;transition.</em></p>
<p>I watch a video of Kate Bornstein,
and think <em>yes, I need to be a woman
before I can be&nbsp;non-binary.</em></p>
<p>Natalie agrees.
<em>Women can be anything.
Transition first, then&nbsp;explore</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Trying on clothes to see if they fit
is way better than trying on clothes to see if your gender fits.
I didn&#8217;t know there was a difference,
but there&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>I can finally hate my body for the normal&nbsp;reasons.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><em>Transgender</em> and <em>Transsexual</em> always existed somewhere else,
in another world.
Extreme terms.
I felt an affinity
for cross-dressers, drag queens, and trans women alike
(I wouldn&#8217;t distinguish until later),
but the connection was fragile.
They seemed so fierce and fabulous
(or do I mean thin?) —
nothing like a thick Indiana&nbsp;farm-boy.</p>
<p>On screen, their stories always ended&nbsp;badly.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I love my new emotional clarity.
I can&#8217;t lift my bass amp, but who cares?
I wish it wasn&#8217;t so cold
all the&nbsp;time.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I called myself trans for the first time
while speaking to 60-some relatives at a family reunion.
Sometimes I do things the hard&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Everyone was supportive,
but no one noticed their pronouns,
and it felt like nothing would ever&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>Grandma asked if I was planning to transition medically,
and I said no.
I was wrong.
I&#8217;ve been wrong many&nbsp;times.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Robert spends the night,
but Audrey isn&#8217;t allowed&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>Later,
the boys tell me not to play with her
on the playground,
and I&nbsp;listen.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A stranger asks me if I&#8217;m
<em>like, full tranny</em>.
That&#8217;s not a&nbsp;thing.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Living as a boy,
pink became a symbol of something
I could never fully imagine.
Pink was a personal rebellion,
played off as&nbsp;politics.</p>
<p>But pink is only subversive for men.
In the end,
my rebellion reinforced my misgendering.
A month into transition,
I cleared all the pink from my&nbsp;closet.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Hormones are slow&nbsp;magic.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I watch Eddie Izzard,
and think maybe I&#8217;m an <em>action transvestite</em>,
but the lazy/fat kind,
who has no time for makeup,
and finds dresses&nbsp;unflattering.</p>
<p>Megan asks if I&#8217;ve been a good boy this year.
<em>I&#8217;m not very good at being a boy,
if that&#8217;s what you mean.</em>
She says I&#8217;m genderqueer,
so I attend the
Trans and Genderqueer Writers&nbsp;Conference.</p>
<p>Rose asks me, <em>what pronouns do you use at home</em>?
That&#8217;s not the question she meant to ask,
and not the question I wish I was&nbsp;answering.</p>
<p>Erin is the first to ask me point-blank.
I don&#8217;t know the answer,
so I ask her to use all the pronouns.
She does that perfectly for a week.
I like it best when she&#8217;s using she or her —
but it&#8217;s hard getting anyone else to follow&nbsp;suit.</p>
<p>I think maybe changing my name
will help people change my pronoun.
It&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I tell Natalie how I feel.
She says
<em>that&#8217;s because you&#8217;re not on hormones yet</em>.
I believe her,
but there&#8217;s a waiting&nbsp;list.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In my dreams, I&#8217;m transgender.
In the mirror, I&#8217;m uncertain.
In public, I&#8217;m a&nbsp;woman.</p>
<p>Being trans isn&#8217;t about knowing your gender,
or even seeing it.
I transitioned on faith —
my intuition jumping out ahead of my identity.
I&#8217;m still surprised when I look in the mirror,
but I look as often as I can —
for the euphoria of that surprise,
or just to normalize it over&nbsp;time.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>— Ma&#8217;am, that account says &#8216;Eric Meyer&#8217; <br />
— That&#8217;s my old… boyfriend? Can I change&nbsp;it?</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I took a few voice lessons,
for a better sense of control over my presentation.
I don&#8217;t worry about a particular pitch,
or gender-socialized speech patterns —
just dropping some of that bass chest resonance.
It was something small I could do
before the hormones kicked&nbsp;in.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>This was never a male body,
it was always a trans&nbsp;body.</p>
<p>My body was trans as a kid. <br />
My body is trans now. <br />
My body will always be&nbsp;trans.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In Colorado,
your chosen name has to sue your given name
for the right to&nbsp;exist.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I had a nightmare about swimming.
First I was worried about the swimsuit I don&#8217;t have.
Then I saw the locker room doors,
and woke up in a&nbsp;panic.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>After years of looking queer,
it&#8217;s strange to realize
you&#8217;re suddenly no-longer noteworthy —
just one more woman walking down the street.
It happened while I wasn&#8217;t paying attention:
the queer kids stopped giving me that knowing&nbsp;nod.</p>
<p>Whatever made me stand out before,
now only blends me&nbsp;in.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><span class="caps">TSA</span> policy is not friendly to trans bodies,
but PreCheck usually gets me where I need to&nbsp;go.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Transition is not a binary.
We all exist on a spectrum,
stretching out in many&nbsp;dimensions.</p>
<p>My transition will never be complete,
and my gender will never be simple or static.
<em>Woman</em> is only one label among many.
None are perfect on their own,
but we live in the intersections.
We contain&nbsp;multitudes.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in authenticity,
but I do believe in pain,
and doing something to survive&nbsp;it.</p>
