      <p>I&#8217;m still reeling from this year of insults,
a traumatizing campaign turned traumatic election.
I&#8217;m not sad about a contest lost,
but what these results mean
for real people around me.
2016 is over,
but 2017 is going to take work,
and I&#8217;m&nbsp;tired.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a good year
in many ways,
and so has <a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-2016-was-actually-one-of-the-best-years-on-record/2016/12/30/bc12701e-ce0a-11e6-a87f-b917067331bb_story.html?utm_term=.27a8e97254b7">the world generally</a>.
Transition has been <a class="reference external" href="/2016/08/17/trans">scary</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="/2016/12/24/clarifications">confusing</a>,
but also wonderful and&nbsp;rewarding.</p>
<p>But over the last few months,
I&#8217;ve watched my friends
(and the Internet)
cycle through denial, anger, depression,
and a million other painful emotions —
often turning on each other
out of fear or misunderstanding.
I&#8217;ve been through a similar cycle of my own —
constantly distracted,
making phone calls,
updating my legal documentation,
struggling to get work done,
building little toy models
to calm myself,
sending donations,
hugging friends,
and breaking into tears
reading article after&nbsp;article.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried to write this post
at least 20 different times,
and I still can&#8217;t get it right.
There is no right to&nbsp;get.</p>
<p>Like many of us,
I live at an intersection of worlds —
female, white, transgender,
able-bodied, lesbian/pan-sexual,
neurotypical, etc —
not sure if I&#8217;m the primary problem
or a primary target.
Probably both.
I&#8217;m tired,
and I don&#8217;t know how to be useful.
How effective is art?
Am I in personal danger?
How useful is my writing?
How complicit am I in which problems,
and how do I fight back?
How can my experiences, my love,
my donations, my company, phone-calls,
or protests help&nbsp;anyone?</p>
<p>I want to be strong,
but I&#8217;m not.
I want to be effective,
but I don&#8217;t know what that means,
and I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s a myth of our&nbsp;culture.</p>
<div class="section" id="personal-political">
<h2>Personal <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Political</h2>
<p>There are several tensions
pulling me in different directions.
Zooming in,
I see individuals hurting —
scared like me.
I know how to be a friend.
I can reach inward,
and care for my community.
I can listen to what&#8217;s needed day-to-day,
and be there for the people around me.
I see you, and I love&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Zooming out,
I get overwhelmed by the scale of our problems —
the ways <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/rise-of-the-davos-class-sealed-americas-fate">neoliberal</a> capitalism,
misogyny, ableism, and white-supremacy
take physical form
to destroy lives in the most mundane ways.
Our representative democracy doesn&#8217;t represent us all,
and never has.
The best we can hope for
is a few simple rights doled out selectively,
or not taken away —
rights we should have by&nbsp;default.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want better jobs,
we want to stop selling our bodies and lives
to corporations for their profit.
We don&#8217;t want to hug police officers,
we want to end the police state.
We don&#8217;t want access to marriage
on hetero terms,
we want to redefine &#8220;family&#8221;
for ourselves.
We don&#8217;t want legal weed for white entrepreneurs,
we want the <a class="reference external" href="http://newjimcrow.com/">prisons emptied</a>
and the war-on-drugs annulled.
We don&#8217;t want the <span class="caps">DAPL</span> re-routed,
we want full sovereignty
and reparations for native tribes,
and an end to environmental&nbsp;destruction.</p>
<p>The status quo was bad enough,
how are we supposed to deal with&nbsp;Trump?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="known-unknowns">
<h2>Known&nbsp;Unknowns</h2>
<p>No one knows exactly <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/21/us/politics/what-trump-wants-to-do-in-his-first-100-days-and-how-difficult-each-will-be.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">what will happen next</a>,
but the threats against marginalized people
(and the environment)
are clear.
We understand the direction,
if not all the&nbsp;details.</p>
<p>We know our government is designed to resist change,
and maybe that will work in our favor now.
But we also know how easily our institutions
are corrupted by money and fear.
Who will fight beside us?
How bad will things&nbsp;get?</p>
<p>The unknowns don&#8217;t make this transition less terrifying,
and the fact that <em>things were bad already</em>
is no consolation.
There&#8217;s a lot to do,
and a lot of people that need our&nbsp;help.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="queering-the-revolution">
<h2>Queering the&nbsp;Revolution</h2>
<p>I see a temptation to grasp for simple explanations,
with simple sides,
and even simpler solutions.
But simplifications are what got us here —
a distraction,
not a plan for change.
It&#8217;s time to embrace
the complexity of human rights,
human systems,
and human identities.
Not to be stopped by wishy-washy complacency,
but to fight for <em>all the people</em>,
no matter how messy that gets.
We need movements for intersectional empowerment
when it would be easier to throw our fringes
under the bus.
We need to challenge all our assumptions
about what is &#8220;normal&#8221;
in this queer and unusual&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>Listening is radical,
emotions are radical,
silence can be radical,
and efficiency
is not the definition of your value.
Speaking up can also be radical,
along with rational thought,
action,
and visible results.
Progress comes in cycles of action and reflection,
mourning and anger,
give and take,
analysis and emotion.
Don&#8217;t get stuck in one place.
Keep cycling.
Keep showing&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>There will always be arguments
about what tactics are better,
more effective,
or <em>enough</em>.
Change will require
all of us doing what we can,
finding new ways to define <em>action</em>,
and new ways of acting.
That will look different
for different people.
The bigger and more diverse the movement,
the&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s annoying,
but we need anarchists <em>and</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sheshouldrun.org/">politicians</a>.</p>
<p>We need to accept that no question is either or.
Individuals are not
either privileged or marginalized
with a simple on/off switch,
but shades of intersectional
identity and experience.
Resistance doesn&#8217;t have to be either violent or polite,
when confrontational nonviolence
has <a class="reference external" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/21/people-are-in-the-streets-protesting-donald-trump-but-when-does-protest-actually-work/?utm_term=.1d9c0a0f5fe8">the only reliable&nbsp;track-record</a>.</p>
<p>We must both acknowledge
our collective and individual racism,
while we more <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;juliaserano/prejudice-political-correctness-and-the-normalization-of-donald-trump-28c563154e48#.eev3frwt1">clearly distinguish</a> between
ignorance, complacency, prejudice,
and active white supremacy.
All bigotry is real,
no matter the intentions,
but different forms of bigotry
call for different forms of&nbsp;resistance.</p>
<p>We can learn to dissect and identify
all the subtle micro-aggressions
of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy">kyriarchy</a>,
and identify where ideas become <em>problematic</em>,
while also understanding
that a barrage of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/16/13426448/trump-psychology-fact-checking-lies">facts</a> and &#8220;callouts&#8221;
will <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/identities/2016/11/15/13595508/racism-trump-research-study">never bring about</a>
the change we need.
We can recognize that personalized education
on privilege and oppression
is not our responsibility as minorities,
but may be our primary responsibility
as activists.
We can acknowledge that
general education is essential in the abstract,
but degrees and certifications are often
an excuse for new hierarchies,
moral requirements,
money, power, and&nbsp;exclusion.</p>
<p>Our bubbles separate us,
but also keep us safe.
Self-care is essential,
and a clever cover for complacency.
Real America is rural and urban,
and infinitely diverse.
Action is essential,
and a clever cover for insecurity.
Incremental progress leaves people behind,
while revolutions often kill the most vulnerable.
We have to be political and empathetic,
listening and fighting.
Move fast and slow,
think personal and systemic.
Respect our feelings
enough to act on them,
and respect our actions
enough to feel them.
Soul-searching won&#8217;t end oppression,
but it&#8217;s an important part of our&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>We have to be human,
in systems that are larger than&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p>Alok Vaid-Menon sums it up well
in their recent <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/AlokVaidMenon/posts/1636504483312005">new years resolution</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>stop using politics to legitimize my&nbsp;feelings</li>
<li>affirm people for being needy <span class="amp">&amp;</span> vulnerable in&nbsp;public</li>
<li>recognize everyone else&#8217;s complexity as much as i do my&nbsp;own</li>
<li>admit when i operate from a place of hurt <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;loneliness</li>
<li>believe in all of our infinite capacity for&nbsp;transformation</li>
<li>provide care as much as i provide&nbsp;critique</li>
<li>respect limitations <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;constraints</li>
<li>honor silence as a form of&nbsp;presence</li>
<li>feel <span class="amp">&amp;</span> love,&nbsp;militantly</li>
<li>refuse the dismissal of art <span class="amp">&amp;</span> interdependence <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;magic</li>
<li>find immensity in what they call&nbsp;insignificant</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And a few of my&nbsp;own:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>accept that my experiences are not&nbsp;universal</li>
<li>embrace a lack of answers and fear of&nbsp;uselessness</li>
<li>show up with my entire self, broken and scared and&nbsp;opinionated</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notes-on-showing-up">
<h2>Notes on Showing&nbsp;Up</h2>
<p><em>Some incomplete notes to myself,
for being present
in a time of&nbsp;struggle.</em></p>
<p>Find and join the efforts already under way.
Find marginalized people
already building movements,
and support them.
Don&#8217;t take over,
or dictate the terms,
or concern-troll and tone-police the movement.
Find ways to stay involved
over the long-haul —
pace yourself but take risks,
and keep showing&nbsp;up.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Check in with people who are scared or in danger.
Take care of each other.
There&#8217;s emotional work to be done.
This is difficult and important.
Don&#8217;t let anyone downplay
emotional experience and expression —
listening, laughing,
and having fun&nbsp;together.</li>
<li>Focus on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.surjaction.org/">bringing new people into the movement</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theestablishment.co/2016/11/11/we-have-to-create-a-culture-that-wont-vote-for-trump/">creating a new culture</a>.
Let marginalized groups set the priorities,
and help to amplify their voices.
Do&nbsp;outreach.</li>
<li>Understand and study <a class="reference external" href="http://code.ucsd.edu/~pcosman/Backpack.pdf">privilege</a>.</li>
<li>Donate time and money
to <a class="reference external" href="http://togetherlist.com/">organizations</a>
focused on
women, people of color,
immigrants, queers, Muslims,
disabled people, <a class="reference external" href="http://sacredstonecamp.org/blog/2016/12/31/standing-rock-to-the-world-10-indigenous-and-environmental-struggles-you-can-support-in-2017">indigenous people</a>
and our global&nbsp;climate.</li>
<li>Support the
<a class="reference external" href="https://policy.m4bl.org/">Movement For Black Lives</a>
and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.joincampaignzero.org/#vision">Campaign Zero</a>.
Get involved with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.surjaction.org/"><span class="caps">SURJ</span></a>.</li>
<li>Donate to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.donorschoose.org">high-poverty schools</a>,
and establish long-term plans for
charitable and political&nbsp;giving.</li>
<li>Follow these helpful
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/174f0WBSVNSdcQ5_S6rWPGB3pNCsruyyM_ZRQ6QUhGmo/htmlview">guides for calling your elected officials</a>
and learn how to affect
political&nbsp;change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fight for diversity in your own industry,
company, and organizations —
in who you hire and what you build.
Create a better training pipeline,
improve your hiring funnel,
write a code of conduct,
address harassment
and micro-aggressions in the workplace,
and keep an eye on retention rates.
There&#8217;s not one single problem,
and it will never be fully&nbsp;resolved.</p>
<p>The long arc of the universe bends
wherever we bend&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Learn to bring
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bC0nyqFNx6VhBgNZDB0Oan1aa0i_UtuWeBLnOPWrJ5M/preview">family and friends</a>
into the movement.
It&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/2016/11/23/13708996/argue-better-science">a skill</a> that takes practice —
emotional labor that
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.vox.com/2014/4/6/5556462/brain-dead-how-politics-makes-us-stupid">can&#8217;t be done by listing the facts</a>.
Outreach requires vulnerability,
discomfort,
and a lot of&nbsp;patience.</p>
<p>Build a practice of sustainable and ongoing action.
Keep looking for new ways to show up,
and leave your ego at home.
Welcome to&nbsp;2017.</p>
<p>Stay strong.
Stay weak.
Stay present.
Keep dreaming,
and get real.
Keep crying, keep laughing, keep&nbsp;fighting.</p>
<p>Take care of each&nbsp;other.</p>
