      <p>At the family vacation in Moab,
everyone is doing their best.
It’s not enough,
and my day is peppered with the wrong name and pronouns.
I hide in my room through dinner
so they won’t see me&nbsp;crying.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Gender is strange and elusive.
Sometime we attach it to genitals,
and sometimes we attach it to boats.
In Spanish,
I even know how to misgender my table.
Every day we gender each other, even strangers –
at a glance, on instinct, with very little to go&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Some gendering is obvious –
from pronouns (<em>he/she/they</em>)
to honorifics (<em>sir/ma’am</em>),
and gendered nouns like <em>ladies</em> or <em>gentlemen</em>.
Things get more subtle when we talk about groups (<em>hey guys</em>),
or the way servers
(should I say <em>waiters</em> or <em>waitresses</em>?)
are trained to serve women first and bring men the check.
The list goes on,
and I notice every instance as though it&#8217;s life or death.
In some cases, it could be.
No matter how we see ourselves,
our existence is constantly gendered
(and misgendered)
by the people around&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>I’ve been misgendered most of my life,
usually by accident.
Unless a classmate wanted to insult me,
by gendering me correctly – ironic as it is.
Looking back,
<em>“long haired african girl”</em>
seems a bit on-the-nose for an insult,
and very problematic.
I had long hair,
was born in Lesotho,
and now I discover I’m a woman.
Three for&nbsp;three!</p>
<p>Now that I’m mid-transition,
this gendering
(and misgendering)
has taken on a new flavor –
a sense of personal success or failure
added to the experience.
I do not mean to imply
that the goal of transition is to be properly gendered,
but <em>wouldn’t it be nice</em>?
When people assume I’m a cisgender woman
life is simpler and safer –
if lacking the nuance of queer diversity.
Even condescending and sexist phrases can feel refreshing –
<em>at least I’m being gendered&nbsp;correctly</em>.</p>
<p>People rarely misgender me these days,
so the sting is worse when it happens.
Strangers on the phone,
old friends on occasion,
or someone just discovering that I’m trans;
but mostly family.
And when it happens,
someone is always there to say:
well, <em>it’s&nbsp;hard</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve misgendered people too,
used the wrong pronoun,
or even a deadname in my worst moments.
It’s an accident, of course,
and I feel terrible about it –
most of us do.
While intentional misgendering is violent verbal abuse,
accidental misgendering is much more complex.
And more&nbsp;painful.</p>
<p>Gendered instincts are taught from a young age –
deeply ingrained, subconscious, and instantaneous.
We use names and pronouns without thinking,
and get them wrong without noticing our mistake.
Sometimes it means we haven&#8217;t shifted our perceptions of a person
and have work to do.
Often, we&#8217;re just bumbling our way through
every child-and-dog-name in our heads before we get to the right word.
My aunt flips through all her children and my deadname
before she gets to <em>Mia</em>.
It would be funny if I wasn’t already&nbsp;hurting.</p>
<p>Brains are strange and language is fragile.
When people tell me (over and over) that <em>it&#8217;s hard</em>,
I know what they mean.
It is hard for all of us.
I know. We&nbsp;know.</p>
<p>But when I’m misgendered, none of that&nbsp;matters.</p>
<p>The room becomes a sudden minefield
and time slows down.
Everyone seems on edge,
unsure what happens next.
One person is feeling bad for their mistake,
aware that they’ve hurt me,
and everyone else can relate.
<em>There, but for the grace of all our gods…</em>
All eyes are on me.
I’m not thinking about the semantic slip
or the person behind it,
I’m trying desperately
to hold my fear and self-loathing at&nbsp;bay.</p>
<p>I never wanted to be trans,
and I’ve learned to hate it.
When I look in the mirror,
it’s all I see.
Then I have to leave the house –
go out in public,
where my existence is so offensive
they pass laws about it.
I’m a national threat.
I get my own special <span class="caps">TSA</span> patdown
and papers-please potty&nbsp;regulations.</p>
<p>Can I even go outside?
Can I use a bathroom?
Who might attack me?
Will I ever date again?
What if I&#8217;m a pathetic joke everywhere I go?
Is everyone laughing behind my back?
If I wear a dress today,
will people gender me right,
or maybe androgyny is safer?
If I&#8217;m too femme,
someone will call me a caricature of ‘real’ women.
If I&#8217;m too butch, it’s proof that I&#8217;m a man after all.
Everything can be used against&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>If the misgendering were intentional,
I could brush it off more easily
(though I would fear physical violence).
Being an asshole reflects poorly on the offender,
and I’m ok with that.
But when it’s an accident,
it feels personal,
like it’s my fault.
I brought this on myself.
I’m asking too much of the people around me.
I look too trans, or speak too deep.
Maybe I’m a failure.
Maybe it’s all a facade
and people are only humoring me.
Now the ruse is up.
Now everyone feels bad
because of something I did.
My trans pain is upsetting these people I love,
and I’m&nbsp;responsible.</p>
<p>I imagine people are thinking about my genitals,
or my deadname, or my years as a ‘boy’.
I know I&nbsp;am.</p>
<p>When I’m misgendered
I slip into survival mode.
There’s no time to take care of myself
when everyone else is anxious, alert, and watching me.
If I fall apart now, I look fragile.
If I get upset, I’ll make it worse –
<em>‘another’ angry trans woman</em>.
If I brush it off,
people think it doesn’t bother me –
<em>not like the others, thank god</em>.
I don’t want a confrontation.
I don’t want anyone to be sorry,
or feel terrible,
or lose sleep over me.
I don’t want to be reminded that
<em>it’s hard</em> not to hurt&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>What I hear is that it’s hard to be around me,
because of what I am –
I’m too easy to offend.
But being misgendered is different from being offended.
I’m not mad,
I’m sad and lonely,
discouraged and afraid.
I feel bulky, masculine, and in the way.
My mind is racing,
and I need a way&nbsp;out.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Back in Moab with my family,
I post a note to Facebook
knowing my trans friends,
at least, will send me support –
and they do.
My brother sees the post on his phone.
In the kitchen later,
he slides up beside me
and says the one thing that actually&nbsp;helps:</p>
<p><em>Hey&nbsp;sis.</em></p>
