      <p>I wasn&#8217;t born in the wrong body.
<em>I was born, a body.</em>
Without my body, I don&#8217;t&nbsp;exist.</p>
<p>Some <strong>bodies have freckles,</strong>
while some are six-foot-four and near-sighted.
Some grow thick hair,
<strong>while</strong> others have autism.
Each body comes with a unique mix of experiences —
affordances and constraints.
This body isn&#8217;t wrong,
it&#8217;s trans.
<strong>My genitals don&#8217;t</strong> match my gender,
the way some bodies&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>You might need help with insulin.
<strong>I need help</strong> with estrogen.
I don&#8217;t mean to medicalize this experience —
only <strong>to claim it</strong>,
and put it <strong>in my&nbsp;body.</strong></p>
<p>I operate best on hormones I don&#8217;t produce.
<strong>Most women</strong> call that menopause.
I call it&nbsp;transition.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><label for="erasure">These fragments</label> are my own,
not a guide to trans experience.
Some will <strong>relate to parts.</strong>
Others&nbsp;won&#8217;t.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There&#8217;s a temptation to cherry-pick the past,
to <strong>emphasize one</strong> particular story-arc,
associate myself with the proper stereotypes,
and prove I was <em>born this way</em> —
a <strong>girl</strong> from my first&nbsp;breath.</p>
<p><strong>In</strong> the final years before my <strong>transition,</strong>
I was begging the pieces to fit perfectly.
I wanted a narrative that could prove my gender,
once and <strong>for all.
That story doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;exist.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>A friend asks</strong> me what it means <strong>to be a woman</strong>.
I have no idea.
What does it mean for you <strong>to be your</strong>&nbsp;gender?</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Dysphoria is a subtle,
grumpy, <strong>subconscious beast —&nbsp;</strong>
like an upset stomach,
<strong>or the anger you feel</strong> when you haven&#8217;t&nbsp;eaten.</p>
<p>Gender dysphoria is <em>hangry</em>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no instruction manual,
<strong>or arrow</strong> pointing <em>you are here</em>.
Your hunger
doesn&#8217;t take the time
to stop and explain itself
before <strong>driving you&nbsp;mad.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>I watch</strong> Eddie Izzard,
and think maybe I&#8217;m an <em>action transvestite</em>,
but the lazy kind with a beer gut,
who has no time for makeup,
and finds <strong>dresses</strong>&nbsp;unflattering.</p>
<p>Megan asks if I&#8217;ve been a good boy <strong>this year.</strong>
<em>I&#8217;m not very good at being a boy,
if that&#8217;s what you mean.</em>
She says <strong>I&#8217;m genderqueer,</strong>
so I attend the
Trans and Genderqueer Poetry&nbsp;Symposium.</p>
<p>Rose asks <em>what pronouns do people use for you</em>?
That&#8217;s <strong>not the question</strong> she meant to ask,
and not the question I wish I was answering.
Neither of us correct our&nbsp;mistake.</p>
<p>Erin asks me point-blank,
but I don&#8217;t know the answer.
For a week,
<strong>she uses</strong> all the pronouns interchangeably,
but I only like the moments of <em>she/her/hers</em>.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s hard</strong> getting anyone else to follow suit.
I think maybe <strong>changing my name</strong>
will help,
but it doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>I tell N— how I&#8217;m feeling.
<em>That&#8217;s because you&#8217;re not on hormones yet</em>.
I believe her,
<strong>but there&#8217;s a</strong> waiting <strong>list.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>I never</strong> felt like a girl.
What do girls feel like?
I didn&#8217;t <em>always know</em>,
and <strong>dream</strong> of wearing dresses.
I wasn&#8217;t consistent, insistent, or&nbsp;persistent.</p>
<p>I was <em>frustrated</em>.</p>
<p>Even after I pinned that pain
<strong>on gender,</strong>
it took years to make sense of the&nbsp;fragments.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t know the pain is real
<strong>until it goes&nbsp;away.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I first <a class="reference external" href="/2016/08/17/trans">call myself trans</a>
while speaking to 60-some relatives at a family reunion.
Sometimes I do things the hard way.
<strong>Everyone is</strong> supportive,
but no one notices their pronouns,
and it feels like nothing will ever <strong>change.</strong></p>
<p>Grandma asks if <strong>I&#8217;m planning</strong> to transition medically,
and I say no.
I&#8217;m&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Cis women warn me about
the <strong>emotional terrors</strong> of estrogen.
<em>Clearly you haven&#8217;t tried testosterone</em>,
I say.
<em>That shit&#8217;ll fuck you&nbsp;up</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Transition is a <strong>wild waffling</strong>
between dysphoria and euphoria.
The <strong>changes</strong> all seem minor,
but the results are <strong>life-changing.</strong>
I&#8217;m the same person,
completely,
and <strong>not at&nbsp;all.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I lose two shoe sizes,
and twenty-two pounds.
<strong>I can&#8217;t lift</strong> my bass amp,
and rarely get turned on —
but when I do it&#8217;s electric.
The world is several degrees colder,
to make up for <strong>global warming, I suppose.</strong>
Emotions live in my body, taking root.
<strong>I&#8217;m all</strong> nerve endings,
raw and <strong>exposed to the elements.</strong>
When I pay attention,
<strong>I love</strong> every second of&nbsp;it.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>He <strong>genders</strong> me right,
in that <strong>condescending</strong> tone reserved for women.
I&#8217;m excited <strong>and&nbsp;horrified.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Many people become frustrated by the trappings of gender —
the rules and regulations imposed by our culture.
<strong>We are not</strong> the only people
to push against these limits.
Then the <strong>boys</strong> find their inner princess,
<strong>and girls</strong> grow up to be president (please),
<strong>and everyone else</strong> moves&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>As my brother says,
<em>cis does not mean&nbsp;simple</em>.</p>
<p>I wanted that story too —
a complex gender,
<strong>breaking from tradition</strong>
without crossing any lines.
I hoped gender was only <strong>a construct,</strong>
and a change in performance could destroy my dysphoria.
I wanted to express my feminine traits and move&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>But <em>feminine</em> is not my gender.
Painted nails are not what it means to be a woman.
Gender is often performed,
but the performance <strong>is not the whole story.</strong>
The play is not the&nbsp;thing.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A visiting trans friend asks where I get my&nbsp;T.</p>
<p><em>I make it inside my body</em>,
I tell him.
<em>I&#8217;d give it to you if I&nbsp;could</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>My doctor doesn&#8217;t require
a therapist&#8217;s approval,
but she tells me
<em>it&#8217;s helpful if you have one</em>.
I don&#8217;t know what that means.
My therapist writes a letter,
just in&nbsp;case.</p>
<p><strong>I have to</strong> sign a form
that explains the effects of hormone therapy.
They bring me the wrong form:
<em>Consent for Masculinizing Hormone Therapy</em>.
I <strong>ask for the</strong> other form, please.
Probably a clerical error,
but it feels&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>This is called <em>informed consent</em>.
Expect <strong>breast growth,</strong>
changes in body fat,
<strong>and thinning</strong> body hair.
Don&#8217;t expect <strong>changes</strong> in voice
or facial hair.
The form is full of typos,
but I sign it anyway.
Later that day,
I take my first hormone&nbsp;pills.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Everyone asks me</strong> if I&#8217;ll keep dating women.
<em>The better question</em>,
I say,
<em>will women keep dating me</em>?
I wonder <strong>which part</strong> of transition
should change who I find attractive.
The name and pronoun,
or hormones,
<strong>or a possible surgery</strong> down the road?
This all <strong>sounds absurd.</strong>
I was bi before,
I&#8217;m bi now,
and I expect to be bi for a very long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Some do find that transition
allows them more comfort
in dating or noticing
different genders than before.
<strong>Sometimes sexuality is just</strong> about
feeling comfortable and paying attention.
Nothing is <strong>set in&nbsp;stone.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I&#8217;m still <a class="reference external" href="/2016/12/24/clarifications">learning to identify</a> as a woman,
and as a lesbian.
<strong>Both are</strong> over-simplifications.
Maybe a non-binary <strong>genderqueer trans woman</strong>
bi/pansexual femme tomboy&nbsp;dyke?</p>
<p>I was assigned male,
and learned to identify as a man —
no matter how odd or painful that felt.
My identity was male <strong>for 33 years.</strong>
Even when the label means nothing to you,
it can be hard to shake&nbsp;off.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>My gender identity is&nbsp;frustrated?</li>
<li>My gender frustration is&nbsp;female?</li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>I&#8217;m terrified</strong> that all I want is
the mythical teenage sleepover,
and <strong>I&#8217;m too late</strong> for that.
The Internet is all tweens and early teens,
afraid they are too old for hormones.
I read all the wrong things,
and cry for&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I told myself I was <strong>too masculine</strong> to&nbsp;transition.</p>
<p>I told myself I looked too young without a beard.
I told myself a beard would allow me to be more queer.
I used my beard as a beard,
in the way gay boys and lesbians team up
<strong>to throw you off the scent.</strong>
I told myself
<em>if you don&#8217;t try you can&#8217;t fail</em>.
If I have a beard,
no one will think I&#8217;m trans.
I was right.
<strong>My own fear and</strong> self-hatred
became my strongest defense.
I told myself <em>it&#8217;s only a body</em>.
I told myself nothing fit&nbsp;right.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A <strong>friend jokes</strong> about the useless buttons
on the <strong>back of my new coat.</strong>
<em>Those buttons aren&#8217;t useless</em>,
I tell him.
<em>That&#8217;s how people know I&#8217;m a&nbsp;woman</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I believed <strong>gender was only</strong> a performance
when my own <strong>gender was a</strong> performance.
Others believe <strong>gender</strong> aligns with genitals,
because theirs does.
It&#8217;s hard to look <strong>beyond</strong> your own experience.
That&#8217;s why we have <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;juliaserano/empathy-politics-d7f62aa90e75#.6p8z24z5w">empathy</a>.</p>
<p>I realized I was <strong>trans</strong>
when rejecting <strong>gender</strong> only made things&nbsp;worse.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I&#8217;ve been fortunate
<strong>to have the partners I have.</strong>
None of us knew
if our relationships would survive this transition,
but both are queer as <strong>fuck,</strong>
and I don&#8217;t know how I would have survived
<strong>without&nbsp;them.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Rachel.
Thank you Erin.
<strong>You mean the world</strong> to&nbsp;me.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I&#8217;m not trans because of the things I like,
or the people I sleep with.
I&#8217;m not trans in order to paint my nails,
fuck boys, join a coven,
or get a free drink on Ladies Night.
I&#8217;m not <strong>exploring my feminine side,</strong>
or enjoying the realities of sexism,
<strong>objectification,</strong> double-standards, mansplaining, and harassment.
I could do <strong>all those things</strong>&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trans because <strong>the doctors called</strong> me a man
and they were <strong>wrong.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I thought I was borrowing a scraper,
<strong>but then</strong> he just cleaned off the car for me.
This doesn&#8217;t happen when you look like a boy&nbsp;person.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The bank ask to see my marriage license.
When <strong>I don&#8217;t have one,</strong>
they ask the reason for my name change?
I make a list of possible&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Just in&nbsp;case.</li>
<li><strong>That time of the&nbsp;week.</strong></li>
<li>I lost my old name, on the bus to&nbsp;Boulder.</li>
<li>Identity&nbsp;theft.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There&#8217;s a <strong>period</strong> where
I can&#8217;t use <em>he/him/his</em> for anyone.
I pause before every pronoun,&nbsp;confused.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t know</strong> how many trans people I know.
After transition, many fade from view.
Cis-assumption helps us blend in,
for our own safety.
Others haven&#8217;t come out&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p>Visibility is dangerous,
but without it we&#8217;re <strong>monsters</strong> under the&nbsp;bed.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Passing&#8221; is not <strong>something I do,</strong>
but something that happens to me —
not a way of presenting,
but a way of being seen.
<em>Fickle</em>.
In a single moment
I <strong>can be seen and not seen,</strong>
gendered and misgendered.
Ungendered, and&nbsp;undressed.</p>
<p>I start using the women&#8217;s restroom
when others start seeing a woman —
not 100%,
but <strong>enough to feel</strong>&nbsp;un/safe.</p>
<p>Suddenly <strong>the men&#8217;s room</strong> feels impossible.
I&#8217;m terrified,
but I&#8217;m waiting for the <span class="caps">FF2</span> from Boulder,
and can&#8217;t hold it any longer.
It&#8217;s been a year now,
<strong>without&nbsp;incident.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>When I say <em>gender change</em>,
people only hear <em>genitals</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>We talk about</strong> socialization,
as though <strong>kids
only ever</strong> hear the half story
intentionally directed their way.
As though we&#8217;re not all taught
<strong>to hate women</strong> equally.
As though I can&#8217;t see past the mistake
when I&#8217;m assigned male,
<strong>and build</strong> my own <strong>feminine shame</strong>
outside your view.
As though I could survive 33 years
without learning to&nbsp;cower.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A friend asks if <strong>I like to dress femme</strong>
in the bedroom,
or roleplay with crossed genders.
I don&#8217;t think <strong>my pain is that&nbsp;sexy.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>I tell my mom</strong> on the phone,
<em>I think I&#8217;m more binary than I think</em>.
She&#8217;s confused.
So am I.
I think I need to&nbsp;transition.</p>
<p>I watch <a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kate-bornstein-queer-icon-reflects-on-queer-and-trans-identity-in-2015_561823aae4b0e66ad4c7ff37">a video of Kate Bornstein</a>,
and think
<em>finally, yes</em>.
<strong>Nothing she says</strong>,
just her existence is enough.
N— says
<em>Women can be anything.
Transition first, then&nbsp;explore</em>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Trying on clothes <strong>to see if they fit</strong>
is way better than trying on clothes <strong>to see if your gender fits.</strong>
I didn&#8217;t know there was a difference,
until everything&nbsp;changed.</p>
<p><strong>I can finally hate</strong> my body for the normal&nbsp;reasons.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><em>Transgender</em> and <em>Transsexual</em> always existed somewhere else,
in another world.
<strong>Extreme terms.</strong>
I felt an affinity
for cross-dressers, drag queens, and trans women alike
(I wouldn&#8217;t distinguish until later),
<strong>but the connection</strong> was fragile.
They <strong>seemed so fierce</strong> and fabulous —
wisp-thin and perfect-femme —
nothing <strong>like a thick Indiana</strong>&nbsp;farm-boy.</p>
<p>On screen, their stories always ended&nbsp;badly.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Robert spent the <strong>night,</strong>
but Audrey wasn&#8217;t allowed to.
Later,
the boys tell me not to play with her
on the playground,
<strong>and I&nbsp;listen.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A stranger asks me if I&#8217;m
<em>like, full tranny</em>.
<strong>That&#8217;s not a&nbsp;thing.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Living as</strong> a boy,
pink became a symbol of something
I could never fully articulate.
Pink was <strong>a personal rebellion —</strong>
pain played-off as&nbsp;politics.</p>
<p>But pink <strong>is only subversive</strong> for men.
In the end,
my rebellion reinforced my misgendering.
A month into transition,
I cleared all the pink from my&nbsp;closet.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Hormones are <strong>slow&nbsp;magic.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>If you are wondering,
<em>am I trans</em>,
the answer is almost certainly
<em>yes love,
and you are beautiful</em>.
<strong>No two stories are</strong> the same,
but what we have in common
is that pain,
and that wondering.
You aren&#8217;t <strong>stuck forever.</strong>
You have&nbsp;options.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>In my dreams, <strong>I&#8217;m&nbsp;transgender.</strong></li>
<li>In the mirror, <strong>I&#8217;m&nbsp;uncertain.</strong></li>
<li>In public, <strong>I&#8217;m a&nbsp;woman.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Being trans isn&#8217;t about knowing
anything clearly,
or <strong>even seeing it</strong> when others do.
I transitioned on faith —
my intuition <strong>jumping out ahead of</strong> my identity.
I&#8217;m still surprised when I look in <strong>the mirror,</strong>
but I look as often as I can —
for <strong>the euphoria of</strong> that surprise,
or just to normalize it over <strong>time.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>— <em>Ma&#8217;am, that account says &#8216;Eric Meyer&#8217;</em> <br />
— <em>That&#8217;s my old… boyfriend? Can I change&nbsp;it?</em></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>I took</strong> a few voice lessons,
for a better sense of <strong>control over my presentation.</strong>
<strong>I don&#8217;t worry about</strong> a particular pitch,
or gender-socialized speech patterns —
just dropping some of that bass chest resonance.
It was something small I could do
before the hormones kicked&nbsp;in.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/07/19/there_s_no_such_thing_as_a_male_body.html">This was never a male body</a>,
it was always <strong>a trans&nbsp;body.</strong></p>
<p>My body was trans as a kid. <br />
My body is trans now. <br />
My body will always be&nbsp;trans.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Recently, I had a nightmare about swimming.
First I was worried about the swimsuit I don&#8217;t have.
<strong>Will I try some on?</strong>
Then I saw the locker room doors,
and woke up in a&nbsp;panic.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I change my last name to Suzanne
to avoid identity confusion in my career.
I pick Suzanne from a list of family names
my parents kindly send over.
<strong>I&#8217;m half-aware</strong> at the time
<strong>that</strong> I should be changing my given name instead.
I move unspecified &#8220;M&#8221; to the middle,
with a sense that I might need it&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>Given different genital circumstances,
<strong>I would have been</strong> Miriam Suzanne Meyer at birth,
or Mary Sue,
or <strong>another variant</strong>.
After three years,
I change my first name to Miriam,
and move Eric to the middle —
for <strong>a sense of gender-queering history</strong>
that I can drop to an initial at any&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The man <strong>at <span class="caps">TSA</span></strong> looks confused.
<em>Is that supposed to say&nbsp;Erica?</em></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>My first night out with</strong> a new name,
I stumble and hate every minute.
<strong>Erin</strong> holds my hand and
introduces me to friends.
<em>This is my girlfriend</em>.
I&#8217;m trying to be dainty,
maybe, or demure.
<strong>It&#8217;s disgusting,
and I want to&nbsp;vomit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hanson is</strong> on the radio.
Why is Hanson on the&nbsp;radio?</p>
<p>I know that
woman is not an action,
but a description —
what I am, not what I do.
<strong>Knowing in my mind
and knowing in my body</strong>
are different things.
Eventually <strong>I&#8217;m able to relax</strong>
and be myself.
It&#8217;s <strong>a new&nbsp;feeling.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>An ex said
she won&#8217;t be happy
until I&#8217;m <em>dead, gay, or castrated</em>.
I&#8217;m <strong>going for the hat</strong>&nbsp;trick.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>After years of <strong>looking queer,</strong>
it&#8217;s strange to realize
you&#8217;re suddenly no-longer noteworthy —
just one more woman walking down the street.
It happened <strong>while I</strong> wasn&#8217;t paying attention:
the queer kids stopped giving me that knowing&nbsp;nod.</p>
<p>Whatever <strong>made me stand out</strong> before,
now only blends me&nbsp;in.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A few months <strong>on hormones,</strong>
and flying becomes <strong>surreal.</strong>
The woman checking <span class="caps">ID</span> says
<em>I guess you&#8217;ll want to get that changed</em>
as she hands back my license.
<strong>Another woman beckons me</strong> through the scanner,
and presses the pink button as I enter —
then pulls me aside
<strong>when the machine highlights
my</strong> gender-failing <strong>crotch.</strong></p>
<p>— <em>I&#8217;m sorry ma&#8217;am, you triggered an alarm.
I mean, excuse me,
we don&#8217;t say alarm now,
we say anomaly.</em> <br />
— <em>Yeah. I&#8217;m trans.</em> <br />
— <em>I know, ma&#8217;am.
Is it ok if I pat you&nbsp;down?</em></p>
<p>I buy PreCheck to avoid the scanners.
Later I learn that a good tuck —
or <strong>six more months</strong> blocking testosterone —
is enough to pass their gender test.
Press <strong>that pink button</strong> all you want.
I guess this is what it means to be a&nbsp;woman?</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In Colorado,
your chosen name <a class="reference external" href="/2017/01/19/america-heard">has to sue</a> your given name
<strong>for the right to&nbsp;exist.</strong></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Transition is not a binary.
We all exist on a spectrum,
stretching out in many dimensions.
My transition will never be complete,
and my gender will never be simple or static.
<em>Woman</em> is only one label among many.
None are perfect on their own,
but <strong>we all live at intersections.
We all contain&nbsp;multitudes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t believe</strong> in authenticity,
but I do believe <strong>in pain,</strong>
and doing something <strong>to survive&nbsp;it.</strong></p>

      This fragmented memory follows a cast of friends
      as they navigate fluid genders and relationships,
      with bodies that resist order, category, or completion.
